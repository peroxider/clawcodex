"""F-97-L schema v1 → v2 migration helpers.

The on-disk event format grew from v1 to v2 in F-97-L. The breaking
change is the shape of ``fields["fingerprint"]``:

* v1: ``"abc1234567890def"`` (16-char hex string)
* v2: ``{"hash": "abc1234567890def", "version": 2, "method": "sha1-truncate"}``

v2 is the *target* for newly-written events; v1 events already on disk
are read unchanged and auto-upgraded via :func:`normalize_event` before
aggregation. The upgrade is idempotent — feeding a v2 event through
:func:`migrate_v1_to_v2` is a no-op.

Why a dict instead of a string? The string form cannot tell us which
hash algorithm produced the digest, so cross-version dedupe cannot
guarantee that two fingerprints were generated the same way. The
explicit ``version``/``method`` fields make that auditable, and the
``hash`` field stays a stable 16-char join key for the daily aggregator.
