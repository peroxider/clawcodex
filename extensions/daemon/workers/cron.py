"""``cron`` daemon worker (placeholder).

The cron Worker is registered so the supervisor can spawn it, but the
concrete ``run()`` is intentionally a no-op until a full
implementation lands. Returning :data:`EXIT_CODE_PERMANENT` would be
over-aggressive — instead we sleep until cancelled, so the supervisor
sees a healthy long-running worker that it can restart cleanly.

Real implementation is tracked as Proactive follow-up and will be a
follow-up patch in ``extensions/cron_system/``.
