"""SOP converter adapter for asciicast recording (F-REC).

The SOP converter pipeline has no native event stream — it writes
artifacts to disk and the CLI wrapper (``clawcodex_ext/cli/sop_cmd/commands.py``)
prints a summary. We use the *rendered-output capture* mode: wrap
``sys.stdout`` with a :class:`TeeWriter` that mirrors every ``print()``
to an asciicast frame, plus emit a start/end marker around the
conversion.

Usage::

    with SopStageProjector(capture) as projector:
        result = convert_sop_to_agent(...)

The projector is a no-op when ``capture is None`` so callers can keep
the ``with`` block unconditionally without paying any cost when
recording is disabled.
