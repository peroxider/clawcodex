"""Team-only tool visibility filter.

When ``ToolContext.team`` is not an active team (i.e. the session has
no team context), drop tools that can only do useful work inside an
existing team: ``SendMessage`` (inter-agent messaging / broadcast) and
``TeamDelete``. ``TeamCreate`` stays visible as the bootstrap entry
that can create the first team context. The model's self-introduction
in single-user REPL sessions used to mis-call ``SendMessage { to: "*" }``
as a way of "replying"; hiding that tool from the API schemas removes
the path entirely.

This module is pure (no I/O, no globals, no upstream-tool mutation)
so it can be unit-tested in isolation and reused anywhere upstream
or downstream assembles a tool list.
