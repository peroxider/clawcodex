"""HostAgentManager — Gateway-hosted default auto session contract (P5).

When an origin has no opt-in REPL/orchestrator binding, the gateway
hosts its own agent session (hermes-style, zero user operation). This
module freezes the contract (cwd / provider-model / approval / tool
policy / transcript / stop-resume / reply-flow) and provides a
minimal skeleton. Full default-agent execution is high-risk and is
implemented incrementally; v1 ships the contract + a deterministic
session-id factory + the reply-to-OutboundDispatcher hook shape so
the dispatcher can route ``newPrompt`` to it without a live LLM.
