"""二开 agent session persistence — session storage read/write hooks.

Extracted from ``src/agent/session.py`` so the upstream Session class
remains free of orchestrator-specific SessionStorage / TailFollower
concerns.

Architecture::

    src/agent/session.py                   ← upstream Session (calls hooks below)
        ↑ import
    extensions/agent/session_persist.py    ← this module (二开 persistence)

Two public hooks:

* ``save_to_session_storage(session)`` — persist conversation messages
  via SessionStorage (JSONL transcript) so ``--resume`` can attach a
  TailFollower to watch for lines written by a backgrounded agent.
* ``load_from_session_storage(session_id)`` — construct a Session-like
  object from a SessionStorage directory if one exists.

F-49 P5-E changes:

* The very first call per session writes a ``session_init`` line as
  line 1 of ``transcript.jsonl`` carrying ``session_id``, ``provider``,
  ``model``, ``cwd``, and ``created_at``. ``Session.load()`` reads this
  line to reconstruct provider/model without needing ``session.json``.
* The duplicate ``cost_block`` write (to both ``metadata.json`` and
  ``transcript.jsonl``) has been removed. ``Session.save()`` now writes
  a ``session_snapshot`` line containing the cost block; cost_restore
  reads ``tail -1`` from the transcript instead of looking at
  ``session.json``.

    """Persist conversation messages via SessionStorage (JSONL transcript).

    Best-effort: errors are swallowed so the upstream agent loop never
    fails on a persistence hiccup. The JSONL transcript is the file
    that :class:`TailFollower` watches during ``--resume``, so it must
    exist and contain all current messages for the resume path to work.

    F-49 P5-E: on the **first** call for a given session, write a
    ``session_init`` line as the very first entry in ``transcript.jsonl``.
    Subsequent calls are idempotent — they detect the existing init line
    and skip writing a duplicate.

    The cost block is NOT written here anymore; ``Session.save()`` writes
    a ``session_snapshot`` line at exit time, and ``cost_restore`` reads
    that line via ``tail -1``. Writing a ``cost_block`` here would
    duplicate the cost on every save and confuse cost_restore (which
    keys on the LAST line of the transcript).

    F-103 P103-E: each message's ``parentUuid`` is set to the previous
    message's ``uuid`` in the conversation list. Root message
    (index 0) gets ``parentUuid = None``.

    Behavioural notes:

    * **Only walks the in-memory conversation, not the on-disk
      transcript.** This is intentional: the chain is rebuilt from
      whatever the model is currently looking at, so rewinds (which
      truncate ``conversation.messages``) automatically produce a new
      chain pointing at the rewind target. The old messages remain
      on disk as a dead branch until ``walkChainBeforeParse``
      prunes them on read.
    * **Defensive against missing uuids.** If a message dict lacks
      a string uuid, its parentUuid is left untouched (we don't
      invent one); subsequent messages still chain off whatever
      previous uuid was last seen. This avoids breaking messages
      that originated from non-standard writers (e.g. legacy
      session_init / session_snapshot stubs).
    * **Idempotent.** Re-running this on the same list yields the
      same chain; we only overwrite an explicit ``None`` if a
      previous uuid exists, so the function is safe to call on
      dicts that already carry a ``parentUuid`` (legacy entries
      or test fixtures).
    * **Pure function.** No I/O. Returns a new list of dict copies
      so the caller's ``messages_list`` is not mutated.

    Args:
        messages_list: list of message dicts (typically from
