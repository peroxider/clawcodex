"""
Skills Extension Layer (skills_ext)

Extends upstream skills loader with clawcodex-specific functionality.
Follows the same pattern as tool_system_ext for consistency.

Architecture:
    src/skills/           - Layer 1: Upstream original code (read-only)
    src/skills_ext/       - Layer 2: clawcodex extension layer (new)

Extension components:
    - SkillRegistryExt: Wrapper for upstream loader with bundle support
    - bundles.py: Skill bundle definitions
    - agent_config.py: Per-agent skill configuration
    - paths.py: clawcodex-specific path resolution
    - hooks.py: Skill lifecycle callbacks
    - cache.py: Extension layer caching
    - bundled/: clawcodex-native bundled skills (SOP converter, etc.)
