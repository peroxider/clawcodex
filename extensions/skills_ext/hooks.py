Skill Lifecycle Hooks

Provides callback hooks for skill registration and lifecycle events.
Mirrors the on_tool_registered pattern from ToolRegistryExt.

Hooks:
    - on_skill_registered: Called when a skill is registered
    - on_skill_activated: Called when a conditional skill is activated
    - on_skill_deactivated: Called when a skill is deactivated
