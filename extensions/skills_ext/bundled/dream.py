"""Dream slash skill — F-100 / 100.4.

The ``/dream`` command exposes the auto-dream service to REPL/headless
surfaces. Mirrors the upstream ``/dream`` bundled skill
(``claude-code-best/src/skills/bundled/dream.ts``).

Subcommands:

* ``/dream`` (no args)    — show usage.
* ``/dream run``          — force a dream consolidation pass now
  (bypasses all gates; stamps the lock optimistically).
* ``/dream once``         — alias for ``run``.
* ``/dream status``       — show in-flight dream tasks on the shared
  :class:`RuntimeTaskRegistry`.
* ``/dream help``         — show usage.

The implementation is intentionally a :class:`LocalCommand` (not a
:class:`PromptCommand`): the user is asking the **local daemon** to do
work, not the model. Wraps :func:`clawcodex_ext.dreaming.manual_dream`
for ``run``/``once`` and reads the
:class:`clawcodex_ext.dreaming.service.RuntimeTaskRegistry` for
``status``.

Wired via :func:`register_dream_skill`, called from
:func:`extensions.skills_ext.init_skills_ext` so the command lands
in the global command registry during skills_ext initialization.
