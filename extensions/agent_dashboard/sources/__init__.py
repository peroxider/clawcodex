"""Agent Dashboard — built-in data sources.

This package ships the two data sources the plan §3 commits
to in Phase 2: :class:`GoalDashboardSource` (reads from
``GoalService``) and :class:`TasksDashboardSource` (reads from
``ToolContext.tasks``). Optional Orchestrator / SOP sources live in
``extensions/orchestrator`` and ``extensions/sop_converter`` and
register themselves against the default registry on import.
