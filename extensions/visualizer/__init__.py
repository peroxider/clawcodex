# The asciicast dashboard source adapter used to live here and
# was reverse-registered into ``extensions.agent_dashboard`` on import.
# The adapter moved to ``extensions.recording.visualizer_dashboard_source``
# where its real consumer (``extensions.recording._factories._visualizer_factory``)
# lives. Recording's factory loader imports it lazily so a partial
# checkout that lacks the recording extension cannot break the
# visualizer import path. No module-level registration happens here.
