"""F-167-A: DashboardEntry/Source/Sink Protocol inlined into visualizer.

Originally this Protocol module lived at
``extensions/capabilities/dashboard_entry.py``. F-167 copies it here so
the visualizer package is self-contained and can be lifted out as an
independent PyPI distribution (``clawcodex-visualizer``) without
pulling in the upstream ``extensions.capabilities`` package.

This is a *local copy*, not a re-export — the upstream module remains
the authoritative reference for ``extensions.agent_dashboard`` and the
orchestrator. Drift between the two should be caught by the manual
6-month diff cadence called out in
``docs/feature_plan/04-architecture-sdk/f-167-visualizer-package-extract.md``
§8 R-1. Any signature or semantic change must be propagated here in
the same commit.

      * ``pull`` — return a fresh snapshot of all current entries.
        ``filters`` is an optional source-specific bag (e.g. session

        forwards whatever the consumer asked for.
      * ``cache_ttl_ms`` — how long the snapshot returned by ``pull``
        stays valid. DashboardStore caches per-source and re-pulls
        only when the TTL elapses. High-frequency sources
        (tasks) should return ~1000ms; low-frequency ones (SOP stages)
