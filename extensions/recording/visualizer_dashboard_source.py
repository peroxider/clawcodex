"""Visualizer dashboard adapter for asciicast recording.

Originally lived at ``extensions/visualizer/asciicast_dashboard_source.py``
as part of the visualizer package. It moved here because its
real consumer is :func:`extensions.recording._factories._visualizer_factory`,
not the visualizer Web UI — the recording CLI polls snapshots on a 1 Hz
tick and renders them as ASCII panels via :func:`extensions.visualizer._rendering.panel`.

This module now lives in the recording package and depends *only* on
the visualizer package's primitives (Protocol definitions in
:mod:`extensions.visualizer.protocols` and the ASCII panel helper in
:mod:`extensions.visualizer._rendering`). The dependency direction is
intentional: ``recording → visualizer`` for rendering primitives, never
the reverse.

The adapter is registered into the
:class:`extensions.agent_dashboard.source_registry.DashboardSourceRegistry`
under the name ``"visualizer_asciicast"`` and is independent from the
live HTML visualizer — it pulls from the same DashboardSource
implementations but produces text instead of HTML.
