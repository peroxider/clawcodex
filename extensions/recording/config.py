"""Recording subsystem configuration (F-REC).

Holds the runtime-tunable knobs for the asciicast recorder. Per the
F-REC plan, defaults leave the recorder fully disabled so existing
runs are unaffected. Operators opt in by setting the config key (or by
invoking ``clawcodex record`` directly, which builds its own writer
without touching this module).

The dataclass lives here (rather than in ``src/config.py``) to keep
the recorder's footprint inside ``extensions/`` — CLAUDE.md's
decoupling mandate forbids adding feature-development modules to
``src/``.

    Attributes:
        enabled: Master switch. ``False`` (default) keeps every
            subsystem on its non-recording path; no per-frame cost.
        output_dir: Where ``clawcodex record`` writes ``.cast`` files
            when the user does not pass ``--out`` explicitly.
        sources: Default source list when ``--sources`` is omitted
            on the CLI. Empty list means the CLI must be given sources
            explicitly.
        flush_mode: ``"per_frame"`` flushes after every event (matches
            the F-REC plan decision; enables ``tail -f``); periodic
            modes are reserved for future tuning and not yet
            implemented.
        default_width / default_height: Terminal size used when the
            capture does not inherit one from a real TTY (e.g.
            headless orchestrator runs).
