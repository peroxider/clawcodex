"""F-93 TeamMem — permission & scope policy (P93-D).

Single authority on team-memory visibility. The :class:`TeamMemoryService`
calls into :class:`TeamMemoryPolicy` on every read/write/delete so the
scope rules from F-93 §1.7 are enforced in exactly one place.

Rules (F-93 §1.7)::

    | scenario                      | rule                                            |
    |-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
    | requester not in team.json    | deny read/write                                 |
    | scope=team                    | all members read; members write                 |
    | scope=lead_only               | lead read/write; member write needs lead approval
    | scope=agent_pair              | author + related_agents read; lead can audit    |
    | delete                        | lead any; author own; others denied             |
    | compact                       | lead only                                       |

The policy is stateless and side-effect free (the audit log lives in
the store, not here). It raises :class:`TeamMemoryPermissionError` on
denial; callers are expected to catch and surface it.
