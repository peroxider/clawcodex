"""F-49 takeover: socket-aligned stop-agent-and-spawn-REPL flow.

Replaces the legacy control-file path with the Phase 1 Unix
control socket. The agent is paused (not killed) at the next
turn boundary; the operator's REPL then resumes the same
``run_id`` so inputs flow into the existing
``transcript.jsonl``.
