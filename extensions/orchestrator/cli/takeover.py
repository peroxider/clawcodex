"""F-49 takeover: read-only snapshot viewer for a running orchestrator agent.

Spawns a ``--resume`` REPL against the agent's ``run_id`` so the operator
can inspect the current conversation history. The orchestrator agent is
**not** paused — it continues running unaffected. When the REPL exits,
the orchestrator proceeds normally. There is no handback: takeover is a
pure read-only snapshot of the on-disk ``transcript.jsonl``.
