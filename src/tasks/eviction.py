"""Eviction sweeper for terminal-state runtime tasks — Chunk D / WI-3.4.

Mirrors ``PANEL_GRACE_MS`` + the eviction-after-deadline behavior
described in chapter §"TaskStop" final paragraph + plan WI-3.4.

Per assumption A8 (TS source-confirmed at
``typescript/src/utils/task/framework.ts:28``): the grace period is
30 seconds. The sweeper runs every 5 seconds, so the worst-case
eviction lag is ≤35 seconds.

Constraints:
1. **Notify before evict.** A terminal task without ``notified=True``
   must NOT be evicted — the parent agent hasn't been told the task
   finished yet, and dropping the entry would lose the
   ``<task-notification>`` envelope. The sweeper skips entries with
   ``notified=False``.
2. **Daemon thread, cancel-on-shutdown.** The sweeper runs on a daemon
   thread so it never blocks process exit. ``stop_eviction_sweeper``
   is exposed for clean shutdown in tests and explicit teardown paths.
3. **Idempotent start.** ``start_eviction_sweeper`` is safe to call
   multiple times; only the first call spawns the thread.
