"""``local_bash`` task type — runtime state and Task adapter.

Chapter-10 / Chunk B WI-1.4 + WI-2.1 land the typed state and the minimal
``Task`` adapter for background-bash. The actual spawn / output-streaming /
reaper logic continues to live in ``src/tool_system/tools/bash/background.py``
and is rebadged in this same chunk to write ``LocalShellTaskState`` into the
new ``RuntimeTaskRegistry`` instead of the legacy ``background_bash_tasks``
dict-of-dicts.

Mirrors ``typescript/src/tasks/LocalShellTask/LocalShellTask.tsx``'s state
shape (TS keeps spawn metadata + Popen handle + reaper bookkeeping on the
state record). The ``kill`` method here is the polymorphic dispatch target
for ``stop_task`` (Phase 5).
