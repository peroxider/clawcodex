"""Shared capacity-wake primitive for bridge poll loops.

Ports ``typescript/src/bridge/capacityWake.ts``.

The TS implementation merges a long-lived outer abort signal with a short-lived
"wake" controller so a poll loop can sleep while at capacity but wake early
when (a) the outer shutdown signal fires, or (b) capacity frees up (session
done / transport lost). This Python port substitutes ``asyncio.Event`` for
``AbortSignal`` and tracks per-``signal()``-call cleanup so callers can release
listeners deterministically when their sleep resolves normally.

The Python API mirrors TS:

* ``CapacityWake.signal()`` returns a ``CapacitySignal`` whose ``.event`` is
  set when *either* the outer signal or the wake controller fires. Callers
  use ``await wait_first(event, ...)`` or ``await event.wait()`` then call
  ``cleanup()`` to detach listeners.
* ``CapacityWake.wake()`` aborts the current wake controller and arms a
  fresh one so subsequent ``signal()`` calls return a new pair.

        The returned ``event`` is set when either the outer signal or this
        wake controller fires. ``cleanup`` cancels the background watcher
        tasks; callers should call it when their sleep resolves normally so
        the tasks don't leak. If either source has already fired by the time
        ``signal()`` is called, the merged event is returned pre-set with a
        no-op cleanup (matches TS short-circuit on lines 39-42).

        **Async constraint**: Must be called from inside a running asyncio
        event loop — ``signal()`` spawns watcher tasks via
        ``asyncio.create_task`` which raises ``RuntimeError`` if invoked
        from sync code with no current loop. The short-circuit path (either
        source pre-fired) avoids this and is safe to call from sync code,
