"""Back-compat re-export shim.

The implementation has moved to :mod:`src.utils.at_file_completer` so the
Textual-based ``/tui`` PromptInput (Phase 3 of the ch13 refactor) can
share the same matching logic with the legacy prompt_toolkit REPL. This
shim preserves the legacy import path for the duration of one release
cycle.

Direct imports of the public + private-helper names are listed
explicitly so test collection fails loudly if a name is renamed at the
new location — a star-import would silently miss tests that reach into
``_filter_candidates`` / ``_is_path_like_token`` / etc.
