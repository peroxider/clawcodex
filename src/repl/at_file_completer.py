"""Back-compat re-export shim.

The implementation lives in :mod:`clawcodex_ext.utils.at_file_completer`.
This shim preserves the legacy ``src.repl.at_file_completer`` import
path for callers that still reach it (the prompt_toolkit REPL bootstrap,
the historical ``tests/input/test_at_file_completer.py``, and a few
``clawcodex_ext/repl/*`` modules that take a lazy import to avoid a hard
dependency on prompt_toolkit at module-import time).

Direct imports of the public + private-helper names are listed
explicitly so test collection fails loudly if a name is renamed at the
new location — a star-import would silently miss tests that reach into
``_filter_candidates`` / ``_is_path_like_token`` / etc.
