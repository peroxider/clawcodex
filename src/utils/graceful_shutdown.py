"""SIGINT / SIGTERM / atexit-coordinated graceful shutdown.

Mirrors ``typescript/src/utils/gracefulShutdown.ts`` +
``typescript/src/utils/cleanupRegistry.ts``. Idempotent registration,
single-execution semantics across the atexit / signal-handler paths.

Plan reference: ``my-docs/ch02-bootstrap-refactoring-plan.md`` P1.2.

Design notes
------------
* **Single execution under racing handlers.** A SIGTERM can fire while
  atexit is already running, and ``sys.exit`` inside the signal handler
  triggers atexit a second time. ``_shutdown_started`` is the
  one-shot latch that ensures each cleanup runs exactly once regardless
  of which path triggers the drain.
* **Best-effort cleanups.** Exceptions inside individual cleanups are
  caught and logged to stderr; they never propagate. This matches the
  TS reference, which is explicit that "we never want a buggy cleanup
  to block process exit."
* **Thread safety.** ``register_cleanup`` may be called from worker
  threads (e.g., the api_preconnect worker). The lock protects the
  list during append/iterate; we snapshot the list under the lock,
  then run callbacks outside the lock to avoid deadlock if a cleanup
  itself re-registers.
