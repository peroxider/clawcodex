"""WI-4.2: warm the TCP+TLS handshake to the Anthropic API.

Mirrors TS ``utils/apiPreconnect.ts``. Fires a HEAD request to
``https://api.anthropic.com`` during init so the handshake (~100-200ms
on cold connections) overlaps with the rest of the bootstrap. The
connection is discarded; the win is in the OS DNS cache + TCP/TLS
session resumption that benefit the first real API call.

**Why threading.Thread, not asyncio.** ``httpx`` doesn't have a
"fire-and-forget without an event loop" mode. A daemon thread runs the
HEAD request while the main thread continues bootstrap; if the request
takes too long the daemon is abandoned at process exit (no blocking).

Skipped when:
  * ``ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`` is set (custom endpoint — preconnecting to
    ``api.anthropic.com`` would be wasted work).
  * ``HTTP_PROXY`` / ``HTTPS_PROXY`` env vars are configured (the warm
    handshake would target the proxy, not the API).
  * ``CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_API_PRECONNECT`` is truthy (escape hatch).
