"""Advisor tool integration.

There are TWO execution modes:

**Server-side** (Anthropic 1P only — Python port of TS ``advisor.ts``):
The model emits a ``server_tool_use(name=advisor)`` block; the Anthropic
API runs a stronger reviewer model on the conversation so far and inlines
an ``advisor_tool_result`` block into the same response. The client only:

1. opts the request into the ``advisor-tool-2026-03-01`` beta,
2. declares the advisor schema in ``tools[]`` (cache-preserving append),
3. injects ``ADVISOR_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS`` into the system prompt,
4. preserves the resulting blocks in conversation history,
5. strips them on requests that won't carry the beta header.

**Client-side** (any provider — no TS equivalent, Python extension):
The model emits a regular ``tool_use(name="advisor")`` block; the agent
intercepts it, makes a *separate* API call to whatever advisor model the
user configured (could be Anthropic Opus, Gemini, GLM, etc.), and feeds
the response back as a ``tool_result`` block. Two roundtrips per advisor
call but works with any tool-calling main-loop model and any advisor
provider.

The client picks server-side automatically when the main provider is 1P
Anthropic AND the chosen advisor model is a valid server-side target;
otherwise falls back to client-side. Users can also force client-side
even on 1P via the ``advisor_client_mode`` setting (useful for non-
Anthropic advisors on Anthropic main loops, or for transparency).

ADVISOR_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS = """# Advisor Tool

You have access to an `advisor` tool backed by a stronger reviewer model. It takes NO parameters -- when you call it, your entire conversation history is automatically forwarded. The advisor sees the task, every tool call you've made, every result you've seen.

Call advisor BEFORE substantive work -- before writing code, before committing to an interpretation, before building on an assumption. If the task requires orientation first (finding files, reading code, seeing what's there), do that, then call advisor. Orientation is not substantive work. Writing, editing, and declaring an answer are.

Also call advisor:
- When you believe the task is complete. BEFORE this call, make your deliverable durable: write the file, stage the change, save the result. The advisor call takes time; if the session ends during it, a durable result persists and an unwritten one doesn't.
- When stuck -- errors recurring, approach not converging, results that don't fit.
- When considering a change of approach.

On tasks longer than a few steps, call advisor at least once before committing to an approach and once before declaring done. On short reactive tasks where the next action is dictated by tool output you just read, you don't need to keep calling -- the advisor adds most of its value on the first call, before the approach crystallizes.

Give the advice serious weight. If you follow a step and it fails empirically, or you have primary-source evidence that contradicts a specific claim (the file says X, the code does Y), adapt. A passing self-test is not evidence the advice is wrong -- it's evidence your test doesn't check what the advice is checking.

If you've already retrieved data pointing one way and the advisor points another: don't silently switch. Surface the conflict in one more advisor call -- \"I found X, you suggest Y, which constraint breaks the tie?\" The advisor saw your evidence but may have underweighted it; a reconcile call is cheaper than committing to the wrong branch."""

       would let the advisor build on its own (potentially wrong)
       earlier output.
    2. **Flatten tool_use/tool_result blocks to text** — the advisor is
       called with ``tools=[]``, but proxies (Vertex-fronted Anthropic
       in particular) reject ``tool_use``/``tool_result`` blocks when
       no ``tools=`` array is sent. Plain text summaries preserve the
       "what happened" information while satisfying the API contract.
    3. **Ensure ends-with-user** — the advisor is invoked from inside
       an assistant ``tool_use``, so the natural tail is assistant.
       Most LLM APIs reject assistant-prefill; append a synthetic user
       turn asking for advice (doubles as a clear prompt aligned with
       ``CLIENT_ADVISOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT``).

    suitable for surfacing as a tool_result with ``is_error=True``.
    ``usage`` is a dict with ``input_tokens`` / ``output_tokens`` keys

    infer.

    ``main_provider`` is no longer consulted for routing — clawcodex
    is multi-provider, every advisor call says exactly which provider
    it wants. The argument is preserved on the signature for callers
    that pass it for backwards compatibility; it's ignored.

    Network failures, model errors, and missing-config conditions are
