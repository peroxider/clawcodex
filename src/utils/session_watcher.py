"""Facade — utils/session_watcher.py has been moved to clawcodex_ext.

This module re-exports the public API so that existing ``from
src.utils.session_watcher import …`` call sites continue to work
during the migration.  New code should import from
``clawcodex_ext.utils.session_watcher`` directly.
