"""Session-scoped git worktrees — the ``--worktree`` / ``-w`` feature.

Port of ``typescript/src/utils/worktree.ts`` (the *session* subset used by
``setup.ts`` and ``WorktreeExitDialog.tsx``): create-or-resume an isolated
worktree at ``<repoRoot>/.clawcodex/worktrees/<slug>`` on branch
``worktree-<slug>``, run the whole session inside it, and at exit either keep
it or remove it (directory + branch).

Worktrees created before the directory rebrand live under
``<repoRoot>/.claude/worktrees/`` and cannot be file-copied (git registers
them in ``.git`` by absolute path), so resume and cleanup accept the legacy
location; NEW worktrees are always created under ``.clawcodex/worktrees/``.

Relationship to the other worktree helpers in this repo — do NOT merge them:
``src/utils/git.py::create_worktree/remove_worktree`` (used by
``src/workflow/worktree.py``) and ``src/bridge/worktree.py`` are throwaway
agent-isolation primitives (``-b``/``--detach``, no base resolution, no
resume, no post-creation setup). This module is the session-lifecycle port
with resume semantics, base-branch resolution, ``.worktreeinclude`` support
and keep/remove bookkeeping.

Process topology: the CLI launcher (``src/cli.py`` / ``tui_launcher``) creates
the worktree BEFORE spawning the Ink TUI, and advertises it to the child
processes via ``CLAWCODEX_WORKTREE_*`` env vars (see :class:`WorktreeSession`).
The agent-server reads the same vars to service the exit-time ``worktree_status``
/ ``worktree_exit`` control requests. ``src/cli.py::main`` strips any INHERITED
``CLAWCODEX_WORKTREE_*`` at entry so a nested clawcodex launched from inside a
worktree (e.g. by the agent's Bash tool) can never adopt — and delete — the
outer session's worktree.

Security note on canonical-root resolution: TS validates ``.git`` gitfile /
commondir backpointers itself (typescript/src/utils/git.ts:126-158) because it
parses those files in-process. We shell out to ``git rev-parse`` instead —
git FOLLOWS pointer files but does not enforce TS's backpointer/ancestry
policy, so a crafted ``.git`` file could still resolve ``--git-common-dir``
into another repo, landing worktree creation and the settings.local.json copy
there. Accepted residual risk: the folder-trust gate has already run on the
launch directory, and the impact is local-integrity-only. Revisit if a
backend-side trust gate ever lands.
