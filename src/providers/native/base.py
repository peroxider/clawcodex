"""Base class for native SDK adapters (F-72).

Native providers sit alongside the existing LiteLLM-based
``BaseProvider`` implementations. The motivation is the same as CCB's
multi-adapter design: the LiteLLM universal facade flattens over a
hundred backends, but the cost is that platform-specific features
(Gemini's ``SafetySetting``, OpenAI's structured-output ``response_format``
JSON-Schema mode, Grok's tool-calling variant) get lost in translation.

Native adapters keep the same ``BaseProvider`` contract (``chat`` /
``chat_stream`` / ``chat_stream_response`` / ``get_available_models``)
so they drop into the existing query loop unchanged, but expose a
``capabilities`` registry that lets the rest of the system reason about
which provider can satisfy a given request without round-tripping the
network.
