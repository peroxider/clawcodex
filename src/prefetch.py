"""Module-level fire-and-forget prefetch (WI-4.1).

Mirrors TS ``utils/secureStorage/keychainPrefetch.ts`` and
``utils/settings/mdm/rawRead.ts``. The TS reference fires
``security find-generic-password`` and ``plutil`` subprocesses at module
scope so the ~65ms wall-clock cost overlaps with the rest of module
loading; the consumer awaits the result later.

**Why subprocess.Popen, not asyncio.** TS runs all top-level code in an
ambient event loop. Python doesn't — calling an ``async def`` at module
level returns an unawaited coroutine and emits ``RuntimeWarning``.
``subprocess.Popen`` returns immediately (the OS schedules the child
process), giving the same overlap-with-module-loading semantics without
needing an event loop.

The handles returned here are awaited later via ``wait_and_read_*``
helpers when the consumer actually needs the data (e.g., the trust-gate
needs the keychain values).

**Singleton semantics.** ``cli.py`` fires keychain + MDM at module import
time so the wall-clock cost overlaps with argparse / config plumbing.
``setup.run_setup()`` then needs the *same* handles — re-firing would
double the cost and orphan the cli.py-spawned children. ``get_or_start_*``
caches per-process: first call fires the subprocess, subsequent callers
get the same ``PrefetchHandle``. An ``atexit`` hook drains any handle
that was started but never consumed so we don't leave zombies behind.
