"""Companion-intro attachment + system-prompt text.

Two functions:

* :func:`companion_intro_text` — the system-prompt block.
* :func:`build_companion_intro_attachment` — guards + dedup + attachment dict.

Plus :func:`format_companion_intro_attachments` — renders companion-intro
into a ``<system-reminder>`` block. Kept separate from at-mention formatting
so neither's scope creeps into the other.
