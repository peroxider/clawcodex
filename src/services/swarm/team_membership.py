"""Team-membership predicates — Chunk F / WI-6.4.

Single source of truth for "is the active agent the team lead?" Used
by SendMessage's plan-approval gate (sender side, Chunk F / WI-7.3),
the mailbox poller's envelope verification (receiver side, per critic
concern C3), and Phase 9's permission-forwarding bridge.

    Mirrors the gate at ``typescript/src/tools/SendMessageTool/SendMessageTool.ts:442``

    * No ``agent_id`` is set on the context.

    unavailable"** — the predicate intentionally collapses both into
    False so authorization checks are straightforward (a not-team-lead
    branch handles both safely; granting permission would be
    catastrophic in either).
