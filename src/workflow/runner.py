"""Production ``AgentRunner`` — the bridge from ``agent()`` to a real subagent.

This is the integration seam. The engine core (sandbox / scheduler / budget /
journal / primitives) is fully unit-tested against the in-memory ``FakeRunner``;
``LiveAgentRunner`` wires the same ``AgentRunner`` protocol to the real
``src.agent.run_agent`` loop, ``finalize_agent_tool`` (final text + token usage),
and the schema-validated ``StructuredOutput`` tool from
:mod:`src.workflow.structured`.

Its app-specific dependencies (provider, tool registry, parent context, the
base worker tool pool, and agent-type resolution) are injected by the caller —
in production, the Workflow tool builds them from its ``ToolContext``. The
structured-output path here is exercised by the ``make_structured_output_tool``
unit tests; the ``run_agent`` composition is validated by live integration
testing (it needs a real provider) and is intentionally thin.
