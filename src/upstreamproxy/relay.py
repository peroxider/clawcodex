"""CONNECT-over-WebSocket relay for the CCR upstream proxy.

Ports ``typescript/src/upstreamproxy/relay.ts``.

Listens on a localhost TCP port, accepts HTTP CONNECT from
``curl``/``gh``/``kubectl``/etc., and tunnels bytes over a WebSocket to
the CCR upstream proxy endpoint. The CCR server-side terminates the
tunnel, MITMs TLS, injects org-configured credentials, and forwards to
the real upstream.

Why WebSocket and not raw CONNECT: CCR ingress is GKE L7 with
path-prefix routing; there's no ``connect_matcher``. The session-ingress
tunnel already uses this pattern.

Wire protocol: bytes are wrapped in ``UpstreamProxyChunk`` protobuf
messages (see ``protobuf_codec.py``) for compatibility with
``gateway.NewWebSocketStreamAdapter`` on the server side.

Implementation differences from TS:
  - **Single asyncio implementation** — no Bun/Node fork (Python only
    has one event loop family).
  - ``asyncio.start_server`` provides the TCP listen surface.
  - ``websockets.asyncio.client.connect`` provides the WS upgrade.
  - ``StreamWriter.drain()`` provides the backpressure primitive (no
    explicit per-socket queueing needed — Python streams buffer
    internally and ``await drain()`` blocks the producer when full).
