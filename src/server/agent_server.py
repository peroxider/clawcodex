"""Agent server — the real :data:`SpawnAgent` for :class:`DirectConnectServer`.

This is the load-bearing piece of the "TS Ink TUI as a client of the Python
backend" redesign (see ``my-docs/tui-interface-redesign/``). It drives the
canonical agent loop (:mod:`src.query.query`, via the
:func:`src.query.agent_loop_compat.run_query_as_agent_loop` adapter) for one
Direct Connect session and bridges it to the NDJSON wire protocol that the
Direct Connect client (:mod:`src.server.direct_connect_manager`, a port of
``typescript/src/server/directConnectManager.ts``) already speaks. Because the
TS client and this server agree on that protocol, the existing Ink TUI can
``claude open cc://…`` straight into this server with no TS changes.

Wire protocol
-------------
server → client (``messages_from_agent``)::

    {type:'system', subtype:'init', model, tools:[{name,description,input_schema}],
     permission_mode, protocol_version, session_id, cwd}     # once, on connect
    {type:'stream_event', event:{...text_delta...}}           # live token deltas
    {type:'assistant', uuid, session_id, message:{role,content}}
    {type:'user',      uuid, session_id, message:{role,content:[tool_result…]}}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'can_use_tool', …}}
    {type:'control_response', response:{subtype, request_id, response}}  # to client pulls
    {type:'result', subtype:'success'|'error'|'cancelled', usage, num_turns, …}

client → server (``send_to_agent``)::

    {type:'user', message:{role:'user', content:<str|blocks>}}            # a prompt
    {type:'control_response', response:{request_id, response:{behavior,…}}} # perm reply
    {type:'control_request', request:{subtype:'interrupt'}}               # cancel turn
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'set_permission_mode', mode}}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'set_model', model, provider?}}
                                             # replies {ok, model, warning?} | {ok:false, error}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'get_settings'|'get_context_usage'}}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'worktree_status'}}
                                             # {ok, active, name?, path?, branch?, git_ok?, dirty_files?, commits?}
    {type:'control_request', request_id, request:{subtype:'worktree_exit', action:'keep'|'remove'}}
                                             # {ok, message} | {ok:false, error}; client uses a LONG timeout

Concurrency model
-----------------
The canonical permission handler is a **blocking, synchronous** callable
(``PermissionAskHandler``). To turn a permission ask into a wire round-trip we
must block *something* until the client answers — but never the asyncio loop
that pumps the WebSocket (that would deadlock: the reply can't arrive). So we
run the whole ``query()`` turn in a **worker thread**, and the permission
handler blocks that
thread on a :class:`threading.Event`. Outbound messages are handed to the main
loop with ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` (asyncio.Queue is not thread-safe).
