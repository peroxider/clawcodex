"""Server-side delivery helpers for background-task completion notifications.

Background workflows (and background agents) run on daemon threads. When one
finishes it pushes a ``<task-notification>`` envelope onto the process-global
queue in :mod:`src.utils.message_queue_manager` (see
``src.tasks.local_workflow.enqueue_workflow_notification`` and
``src.tasks.local_agent``'s agent equivalent). The interactive consumer of that
queue used to be the Rich REPL (``src/repl/task_notifications.py``, removed in
#566); this module is its agent-server successor — the worker loop drains the
queue between turns and, for every drained envelope:

* emits a deterministic completion **banner** to the client (a
  ``system/task_notification`` frame the TUI renders as a persistent transcript
  line), and
* hands the envelopes back to the agent as one **turn** so it can read the
  result and summarize it conversationally — the Claude Code "the research is
  done…" behavior.

Everything here is pure and side-effect free (no emit, no registry mutation,
no queue access) so it unit-tests without a live server; the glue in
``src/server/agent_server.py`` is the thin part that wires it to the wire
protocol and the worker inbox. Banners are plain text (the client styles its
own transcript lines), unlike the Rich-markup originals.
