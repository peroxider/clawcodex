"""Canonical settings-file paths for permission persistence.

Port of the TS destination→file mapping used by ``persistPermissionUpdate``
(typescript/src/utils/permissions/permissionSetup.ts), with the project tier
namespaced under ``.clawcodex/`` rather than TS's ``.claude/``: the real
Claude Code harness owns ``<project>/.claude/settings{,.local}.json``, and a
second tool reading/writing the SAME files would inherit and mutate the
harness's live permission rules (review-A finding, C1). The file LAYOUT is
still TS-parity — standalone settings files with a top-level ``permissions``
key (the shape ``setup.py``/``updates.py`` share) — NOT the config manager's
``"settings"`` sub-key layer and NOT ``~/.clawcodex/config.json``.
