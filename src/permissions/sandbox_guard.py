"""Sandbox availability guard (C8 — the silent-unsandboxed footgun).

The port does NOT implement sandbox ENFORCEMENT: TS wraps the external
``@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime`` (macOS Seatbelt / Linux bubblewrap) via
``SandboxManager``; the port has only the decision helper
(``bash_security.should_sandbox_command``, currently unwired) and runs a bare
``subprocess.Popen`` (bash_tool.py). So in the port the sandbox is permanently
UNAVAILABLE.

That is not a divergence to hide — it maps exactly onto TS's OWN documented
sandbox-unavailable path (``entrypoints/sandboxTypes.ts:96-103``): when
``sandbox.enabled`` is true but the sandbox cannot start,

  * ``failIfUnavailable: true``  → "Exit with an error at startup" (a
    managed-settings HARD GATE — sandboxing is required, so running
    unsandboxed is a refusal, not a warning), and
  * ``failIfUnavailable: false`` (default) → "a warning is shown and commands
    run unsandboxed".

This module surfaces that guard so a user who asked for a sandbox is never
silently given an unsandboxed shell. Actual enforcement (a native
``sandbox-exec``/``bwrap`` engine) is the deferred
**sandbox-native-enforcement** sub-chapter.

SCOPE — two distinct mechanisms (critic C8):

* The WARNING path (``enabled`` and not ``failIfUnavailable``) is
  BashTool-scoped, like TS ``shouldUseSandbox`` (called only from
  ``bashPermissions.ts``): it warns once and runs the command unsandboxed.
  Hooks/MCP/`/bg` running unsandboxed here is faithful — TS doesn't sandbox
  those either.
* The HARD GATE (``enabled`` + ``failIfUnavailable``) is a REFUSE-TO-START, not
  a per-command refusal — TS exits at the entrypoints (print.ts:600 /
  REPL.tsx:2362, "refusing to start without a working sandbox"). The port
  enforces it in ``agent_server._build_runtime`` (``sess.init_error`` → the
  session refuses to start, so MCP + hooks never run) AND in
  ``_handle_control_request`` (a refused session rejects ``bg_run``/``bg_agent``
  and every other control request except ``interrupt`` — /bg is a CONTROL
  request that bypasses _build_runtime and the turn path) AND at ``_bash_call``
  as a CLI-path backstop. So the "hard gate" is truthful: nothing runs, not
  just Bash.
