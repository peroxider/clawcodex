"""
Remote / bridge safe-command filtering.

Python port of the REMOTE_SAFE_COMMANDS / BRIDGE_SAFE_COMMANDS / isBridgeSafeCommand
logic in typescript/src/commands.ts:643-712. Gates which slash commands may run in
--remote mode and over the Remote Control bridge (mobile/web), now load-bearing after
the CLI-parity transport port (src/transports/).

Membership is by command NAME (not object identity as in TS): a frozenset of names is
stable across registry instances and lets the policy name commands that are not ported
yet (the allowlist is a forward-looking policy, not a runtime object set).
