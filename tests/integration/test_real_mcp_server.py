"""Real-MCP-server smoke test (WI-0.3 acceptance).

Verifies that the Python MCP stdio transport speaks the canonical
newline-delimited framing by connecting to the official
``@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything`` test server via ``npx``.
If this passes, we know the framing fix in WI-0.1 is spec-compliant.

Automatically skipped when Node/npx is not available, so CI without
Node won't fail; environments with Node will run the test (which
downloads the npm package on first invocation — slow).
