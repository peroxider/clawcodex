"""Tests for GatewayIpcClient auto-reconnect (exp backoff + re-register).

Covers the three P5 residual-risk contract boundaries:

  1. A redelivered ``delivery_id`` after reconnect hits the gateway's
     server-side dedup (``InboundDispatcher`` keys on ``message_id``) —
     reconnect must not duplicate.
  2. After the gateway daemon restarts, reconnect re-registers so the
     binding is rebuilt (origin visible as active again).
  3. During the disconnect gap the gateway does NOT replay inbound that
     arrived while the opt-in target was offline (no offline payload
     store — contract boundary). The test asserts the gap message is
     rejected as ``target_offline`` / not delivered to the handler.

Plus the basic backoff-escalation happy path.
