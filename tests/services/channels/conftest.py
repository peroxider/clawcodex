"""Pytest configuration for the channels test package.

The CI sandbox intercepts DNS and returns a private-range address for any
hostname lookup. That makes ``validate_webhook_url`` reject real-looking
public hostnames used in test fixtures, even though they would resolve
correctly in production. To keep channel construction tests deterministic
and DNS-independent, we monkeypatch ``socket.getaddrinfo`` to return a
stable public address for any hostname the channels package tries to
resolve.

Tests that want to assert specific resolution behavior can override this
fixture with their own ``socket.getaddrinfo`` patch.
