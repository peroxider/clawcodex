"""Plan 3: REPL-side context-aware Tab registration.

The Python port of claude-code-best's ``useTypeahead`` registers a
``tab`` binding with a filter alongside the configured accept key.
This test pins the registration shape so the contract is explicit:

* The configured accept key is bound (default ``c-e``).
* A ``tab`` binding is also registered, with a non-trivial filter
  (``Condition`` instance wrapping a callable that inspects the
  current buffer's ``suggestion`` and ``complete_state``).
* The hint string is consistent across the configured key and Tab.
