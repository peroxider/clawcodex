"""Regression tests for abort-signal-aware streaming in the Anthropic provider.

Before this fix, ``provider.chat_stream_response`` had no way to observe
a tripped abort controller. The agent loop's ``cancel_signal`` was only
checked between chunks via the optional ``on_text_chunk`` callback — but
``on_text_chunk`` never fires for a turn that emits tool_use blocks
without intervening text. The result: ESC during a multi-tool-use
response (e.g. the model emitting eight parallel ``Write`` calls) waited
the full model latency before the outer query loop's abort check fired,
producing the "ESC takes 20+ seconds" symptom on the default REPL UI.

The fix threads an ``AbortSignal`` through ``chat_stream_response``. The
Anthropic provider registers a listener that calls
``stream.response.close()`` when the signal fires; the SDK's blocking
socket read raises in the consumer thread, the provider catches it,
detects the abort via the signal state (not the exception type — the
SDK can raise several different classes depending on which syscall was
in flight), and re-raises ``AbortError``. The query loop's existing
abort-aware exception handler then routes through the same cancellation
processing as any other in-flight cancel.

These tests pin the provider-level contract using a synthetic stream
object that mimics the SDK's surface (``__enter__`` / ``__exit__`` /
``text_stream`` / ``response.close()``). We don't exercise the real
Anthropic SDK — that would require a live API key.
