"""Regression test for F-43 REPL routing fix.

The REPL's ``handle_command`` historically had a hardcoded TUI-only
whitelist that intercepted ``/model`` and printed "is only available in the
Textual TUI" before the runtime command could run. This test guards the
fix by asserting that ``/model`` and ``/provider`` are NOT in the
TUI-only whitelist and that the new command system carries them.

The CLI/TUI alignment (F-43 follow-up) also removed the legacy
``/models`` alias from the REPL built-ins; the unified ``/model`` slash
command now serves both display and switch in REPL and TUI.
