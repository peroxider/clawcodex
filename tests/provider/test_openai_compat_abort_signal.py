"""Regression tests for abort-signal-aware streaming in OpenAI-compatible providers.

Before this fix, ``OpenAICompatibleProvider.chat_stream_response`` only
had the pre-call fast-path from PR #144 — no mid-stream cancellation.
Users on LiteLLM / GLM / OpenAI / DeepSeek hitting ESC during a model
turn waited the full model latency before the outer query loop's
abort check fired, same 20+ second symptom this whole effort started
with on the Anthropic path.

This module pins the new behavior. We don't exercise the real OpenAI
SDK — a synthetic stream fake mimics the surface the provider reads
(``response.close()`` plus a slow-yielding iterator).
