"""Pytest fixtures for ``clawcodex_ext.agent`` tests.

The :class:`AgentRegistry` is process-global state. We use a
**save/restore** strategy so the bundled agents (which are eagerly
registered on first import of ``clawcodex_ext.agent``) stay visible
to every test, while mutations made by individual tests are
reverted on teardown. Tests that *want* a clean slate can call
:func:`AgentRegistry.clear` themselves.
