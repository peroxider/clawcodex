"""Unit tests for :mod:`clawcodex_ext.providers._stream_drain`.

These tests exercise the worker-thread + 100ms queue-poll drain in
isolation against a fake stream, without needing a live Anthropic /
Minimax SDK or HTTP server. They cover:

* Happy-path delivery of all non-empty chunks.
* Empty-chunk skipping.
* Cancel-latency bound: a blocking stream must be abandoned within
  ~200ms of the abort signal firing (one poll tick + margin).
* Exception propagation: errors raised inside the underlying
  ``text_stream`` generator surface on the main thread.
