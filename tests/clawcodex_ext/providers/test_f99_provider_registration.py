"""F-99 regression test: ``ClawcodexAnthropicProvider`` must be registered
in ``_EXTRA_PROVIDER_CLASSES`` before any ``get_provider_class(...)`` lookup.

Background
----------
F-99 added three cancel-latency mechanisms (httpx ``read_timeout``,
transport close, tool-stage ``FIRST_COMPLETED`` poll). They were all
unit-tested in isolation and 100 regression tests passed. Despite
that, a user reported the production CLI still hangs at "Cancelling…"
for ~63s on Ctrl+C.

Root cause: ``clawcodex_ext/providers/__init__.py`` (which calls
``register_provider("anthropic", _ClawcodexAnthropicProvider_lazy)``)
was never imported during normal REPL startup. So
``get_provider_class("anthropic")`` fell through to the bare upstream
``AnthropicProvider``, whose ``chat_stream_response`` iterates
``stream.text_stream`` on the **main thread** with only the advisory
``response.close()`` (plus the dead-code ``_close_transport_safely``
helper that looks up ``response._transport`` — which doesn't exist
on ``httpx.Response``; the attribute lives on the client). Cancel
latency collapses to the platform socket timeout (~60s).

The fix is a single side-effect call to ``_init_provider_extensions()``
in ``clawcodex_ext/__init__.py:ensure_eager_extensions_installed()``,
which runs from ``clawcodex_ext/init.py:init()`` after all ``src/``
modules are fully loaded. The init function is idempotent and registers
the three downstream providers (anthropic, minimax, openai-codex) with
their cancel-latency-fixed implementations.

These tests pin that contract: after the deferred init runs,
``_EXTRA_PROVIDER_CLASSES`` must contain the cancel-latency override
so the bare upstream class never wins the ``get_provider_class("anthropic")``
lookup. They also pin that the ``minimax`` override is registered for
symmetry.
