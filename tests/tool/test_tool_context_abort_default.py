"""Pin the ``ToolContext.abort_controller`` non-optional contract.

Previously the field defaulted to ``None`` and every reader had to
defensively guard with ``getattr(..., None)`` or ``ctrl and …``. The
"field is None" hazard class is what allowed the original ESC-into-
subagent bug to slip through: the bridge was supposed to plumb the
field but forgot, and silently every downstream tool ran a fresh
disconnected controller.

The dataclass factory now installs an untripped ``AbortController`` on
every fresh context, so readers can drop the defensive checks and a
forgotten plumbing call no longer regresses ESC propagation into a
silent "the controller is None" landmine.
