"""Phase 1 tests for the Unix control socket.

Covers:
  * Lifecycle: start creates the socket file, stale files are unlinked,
    stop removes the file, both ops are idempotent.
  * Command receiving: pause / resume+payload, malformed JSON is
    skipped, invalid shapes are skipped, FIFO ordering holds.
  * Event broadcasting: single + multi-client, no-clients no-op,
    disconnected client doesn't break broadcast, ``EventFrame`` is
    serialized with ``ts``.
  * AgentSession integration: socket attaches to a real session, events
    dispatched via ``send_event`` reach connected clients, commands
    received via the socket drive session state via ``poll_commands``.

Uses ``unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`` (the repo's canonical async
test pattern) and ``tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`` for socket path
isolation.
