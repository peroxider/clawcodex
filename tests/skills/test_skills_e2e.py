"""QA-2 — End-to-end real-skill tests.

Drops three example SKILL.md files (under ``tests/fixtures/skills/``)
into a workspace's ``.claude/skills/`` tree (via tmp-path symlink) and
exercises them through the full ``SkillTool`` pipeline:

    fixture SKILL.md  ──►  load via get_all_skills  ──►  invoke via
    SkillTool.call    ──►  rendered prompt with all transforms applied

The fixtures (live on disk under ``tests/fixtures/skills/``):

  - ``commit-helper``     simple skill with args, ``${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}``,
                          ``${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}``, allowed-tools.
  - ``frontend/add-component``
                          nested-namespace skill (resolves as
                          ``frontend:add-component``); has ``when_to_use``
                          and a named arg.
  - ``lint-py``           conditional skill (paths-gated) that ALSO has a
                          ``!`pwd``` shell block — exercises both the
                          conditional-activation gate and the shell-exec-
                          in-prompt path end-to-end.

Plus one bundled-skill invocation (``simplify`` from DEV-5) to cover
the bundled-path wiring through SkillTool.

Acceptance criteria covered:
  1. ``pytest tests/test_skills_e2e.py -v`` passes.
  2. ``commit-helper`` test asserts arg, ``${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}``,
     ``${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}``, base-dir header all present.
  3. ``frontend:add-component`` invocation by namespaced name succeeds.
  4. ``lint-py`` not invokable until
     ``activate_conditional_skills_for_paths`` matches.
  5. ``simplify`` bundled skill exercised end-to-end through SkillTool.
