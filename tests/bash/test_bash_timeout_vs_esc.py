"""Regression tests for bash timeout vs ESC-cancel distinction.

Before this fix, the Python bash supervisor (``_run_bash_with_abort``)
set ``interrupted=True`` on BOTH ESC-abort and timeout. The two paths
then collapsed into one tool_result shape:

* content ends with ``<error>Command was aborted before completion</error>``
* ``is_error: True``

The TS reference at ``typescript/src/utils/ShellCommand.ts:135-141, 302,
323-328`` and ``typescript/src/tools/BashTool/BashTool.tsx:610-630``
deliberately keeps the two paths distinct:

* **ESC abort**: SIGKILL → exit code 137 → ``interrupted=true`` →
  ``is_error=true`` → ``<error>Command was aborted before completion</error>``
* **Timeout**: SIGTERM → exit code 143 → ``interrupted=false`` →
  ``is_error=false`` → stderr is prepended with
  ``"Command timed out after <duration>"`` and the ``<error>`` tag is NOT
  added.

Why the asymmetry: ``is_error=true`` is a Claude API signal that the
tool failed. ESC is a user-initiated rejection so the model should not
retry. Timeout is a non-fatal runtime condition; the model reads the
duration marker in stderr and decides whether to retry with a longer
timeout, change the approach, or give up — the ``<error>`` tag would
falsely promote a timeout to a tool failure.

These tests pin the parity at three layers:

1. ``_run_bash_with_abort`` returns ``interrupted=False, timed_out=True``
   on timeout (and the converse on ESC).
2. ``_bash_call`` produces distinct ToolResult shapes for the two cases.
3. ``_bash_map_result_to_api`` only emits the ``<error>`` tag and
   ``is_error=True`` for the ESC path.
