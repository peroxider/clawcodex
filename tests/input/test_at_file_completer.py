"""Unit tests for :mod:`src.repl.at_file_completer`.

Focus on the parts that don't need a real prompt_toolkit Application:
the trigger regex (token detection), candidate ranking, and the
``Completion`` shape (``text`` includes the leading ``@``;
``start_position`` covers the whole ``@<query>`` span so accepting a
suggestion replaces ``@partial`` with ``@/path/to/file``).
