"""LLM-driven recall of relevant memories.

Ports `typescript/src/memdir/findRelevantMemories.ts`. Replaces the
keyword-heuristic in ``src/context_system/memory_prefetch.py`` with the
chapter's named pipeline:

    scan → filter already-surfaced → manifest → side-query →
    validate filenames → return RelevantMemory list

The keyword fallback is intentionally removed. The chapter rejects it
("embedding similarity / keyword matching cannot express 'do not select
memories for tools already in active use'"). On provider failure, return
an empty list.
