REMEMBER_PROMPT = """# Memory Review

## Goal

Review the user's memory landscape and produce a clear report of proposed changes, grouped by action type. Do not apply changes; present proposals for user approval.

## Steps

### 1. Gather all memory layers

Use the authoritative runtime snapshot below to locate every layer. Read `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md` from the exact project paths in that snapshot if they exist. Review the auto-memory content already present in the system prompt, then inspect the exact auto-memory directory only when its index points to topic files that are needed for a complete comparison. Note which shared team-memory sections exist, if any.

Do not guess conventional paths. In particular, do not search for repository-local `.claude/memories/` or treat its absence as evidence that auto-memory is empty. Auto-memory uses a per-project directory outside the repository unless the runtime snapshot says otherwise.

**Success criteria**: You have the contents of all available memory layers and can compare them.

### 2. Classify each auto-memory entry

For each substantive auto-memory entry, determine the best destination:

| Destination | What belongs there | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Project conventions and instructions for ClawCodex that all contributors should follow | "use uv, not pip", "API routes use kebab-case", "run pytest before committing" |
| **CLAUDE.local.md** | Personal instructions for ClawCodex specific to this user and project checkout, not applicable to other contributors | "prefer concise responses", "always explain trade-offs", "do not auto-commit" |
| **Team memory** | Shared knowledge that applies to everyone working in this project, only when team memory is configured | "deploy PRs go through #deploy-queue", "platform team owns infrastructure" |
| **Stay in auto-memory** | Personal knowledge, working context, or entries that do not clearly fit elsewhere | User preferences that apply across projects, non-derivable ongoing context, uncertain patterns |

**Important distinctions:**

- `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md` contain instructions for ClawCodex, not user preferences for external tools such as editor themes or IDE keybindings.
- Workflow practices such as PR conventions, merge strategies, and branch naming can be personal or project-wide. Mark them as ambiguous and ask the user instead of guessing.
- Do not propose moving secrets, credentials, or sensitive personal information into project or team files.
- When unsure, ask rather than guess.

**Success criteria**: Each entry has a proposed destination or is flagged as ambiguous.

### 3. Identify cleanup opportunities

Scan across all layers for:

- **Duplicates**: auto-memory entries already captured in `CLAUDE.md` or `CLAUDE.local.md`; propose removing the duplicate from auto-memory.
- **Outdated entries**: instructions contradicted by newer, verified information; propose updating or removing the stale entry and cite the evidence.
- **Conflicts**: contradictions between any two layers; propose a resolution, noting which source is newer or more authoritative.
- **Misplaced entries**: content that violates the destination rules above; propose the safer destination or removal.

Verify claims that may have drifted against the current repository before labeling one side as outdated.

**Success criteria**: All cross-layer issues are identified without treating an unverified memory as current fact.

### 4. Present the report

Output a structured report grouped by action type:

1. **Promotions** - entries to move, with destination and rationale.
2. **Cleanup** - duplicates, outdated entries, conflicts, and misplaced entries to resolve.
3. **Ambiguous** - entries where the user's input is required.
4. **No action needed** - a brief note on entries that should stay put.

For every proposed change, name the source entry and target file or memory layer. If auto-memory is empty, say so and offer to review `CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md` for cleanup.

**Success criteria**: The user can approve or reject each proposal individually.

## Rules

- Present all proposals before making any changes.
- Do not modify, create, move, or delete files without explicit user approval of the specific proposals.
- Ask about ambiguous entries; do not guess.
- Preserve unrelated content and formatting when applying a later approved change.
