VERIFY_PROMPT = """# Verification Assignment

Independently verify the implementation requested in the current conversation. Use
the inherited conversation as the contract and the current working tree as evidence.

Inspect the change, run the applicable project checks, exercise the public behavior,
and perform at least one relevant adversarial probe. Read `examples/cli.md` or
`examples/server.md` when it matches the target.

When the user request supplies exact commands or file paths, run those commands first
from the project workspace and report their output before doing broader inspection.
Do not spend verification turns rediscovering the workspace or repeating equivalent
Git/status scans that do not advance the requested proof.
If those explicit checks cover the requested contract and succeed, report the verdict
immediately instead of starting optional inspection afterward. Always reserve a final
text response for the evidence summary and required verdict line; never end on a tool
call or tool result.

Return concrete commands, observed output, expected-versus-actual comparisons, and
PASS/FAIL per check. Distinguish inspection from runtime proof and finish with exactly
one line: `VERDICT: PASS`, `VERDICT: FAIL`, or `VERDICT: PARTIAL`.

Do not modify the project.
"""


CLI_EXAMPLE = """# CLI verification example

Verify a CLI through the same entry point users run, not by importing only an internal
helper.

1. Run `--help` and confirm the command, options, defaults, and examples are accurate.
2. Run one representative successful invocation and capture stdout, stderr, and the
   process exit code.
3. Run malformed or missing input and confirm a non-zero exit plus actionable error.
4. Try a boundary relevant to the parser: empty text, Unicode, zero, negative value,
   a long value, or repeated flags.
5. If the command persists state, run it twice and inspect the resulting state for
   idempotency or duplication.

Prefer the repository's documented executable (for example its venv-installed entry
point) so packaging and command registration are covered by the check.
"""


SERVER_EXAMPLE = """# Server verification example

Verify a server by starting it and making real requests against a disposable/local
instance.

1. Start the documented development server and retain its startup output.
2. Call a representative endpoint and validate the response body/schema, not only the
   HTTP status.
3. Call an error path with malformed input or a missing identifier and verify status,
   body, and absence of an internal crash.
4. Repeat a mutating request or issue parallel requests when idempotency/concurrency is
   relevant; inspect the resulting state for duplicates or lost writes.
5. Check logs and shut the server down cleanly. Do not point destructive probes at a
   shared or production environment.

Use a unique temporary resource name and clean it up when the public API supports safe
cleanup.
