"""Bind live runtime objects onto a :class:`ToolContext`.

Entry points may either construct a fresh context or receive one from a
``RuntimeContext``/SDK caller.  In both cases tools must see the registry,
session id, and provider that own the current run.  Keeping the assignment in
one small helper prevents injected contexts from retaining stale references.
