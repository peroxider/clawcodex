"""Heuristic "don't ask again" rule suggestions for Bash permission asks.

Port of the non-LLM derivation in typescript/src/tools/BashTool/
bashPermissions.ts (suggestionForExactCommand :245-273,
getSimpleCommandPrefix :140-168, extractPrefixBeforeHeredoc :285-316,

builders in utils/permissions/shellRuleMatching.ts (suggestionForPrefix
:211-227, suggestionForExactCommand :189-205 — both emit a single
``addRules``/``allow`` update destined for ``localSettings``).

Deliberate divergence: the TS Haiku-based prefix extractor
(utils/shell/prefix.ts ``getCommandSubcommandPrefix``) is NOT ported —
it is an LLM classifier call; C1 ships the deterministic heuristics only.
ANT_ONLY_SAFE_ENV_VARS is dropped (no ant user-type in Python).

    Port of the ESSENTIAL semantics of TS ``splitCommand``
    (utils/bash/commands.ts:85-265) for the permission layer: the original is
    a shell-quote-based module hardened against heredoc/continuation/comment
    parser differentials; this port instead REFUSES (returns ``None``) on any
    construct it cannot split with certainty:

    - command substitution (``$(`` or backticks) and ANSI-C quoting (``$'`` —

    - unterminated quotes, or more than :data:`MAX_SUBCOMMANDS` pieces.

    Refusal is always SAFE: callers fall back to today's behavior (the

    the same traversal as :func:`contains_unquoted_chaining` so the two agree
    on what counts as chaining; redirections (``2>&1``, ``&>``, ``>``) are NOT
    operators and stay inside their sub-command's text (the port's matcher
    treats redirects as plain arguments — the documented pre-existing
