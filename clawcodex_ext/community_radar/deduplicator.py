"""Cross-project feature deduplicator for SR-5.1.

Mirrors the contract sketched in FEATURE_PLAN.md §10.1.6:

> 跨项目去重: 基于 title + description 的语义相似度 (TF-IDF + cosine),
> 同一特性在不同项目出现时合并为一个 FeatureRecord 并填充 related_projects.

The implementation ships two strategies:

1. **TF-IDF cosine** (default, pure-stdlib) — tokenise ``title +
   description`` after lowercasing + stop-word stripping, build a
   sparse TF vector per record, then cosine-similarity. Vectors are
   **pre-computed once** for all records to avoid O(N²) rebuilds.

2. **Exact-match fallback** — when only one record is present or TF-IDF
   would produce a degenerate zero-vector (e.g. all stop words), fall
   back to case-folded title prefix matching so common short titles
   like "Add context compression" are not silently dropped.

``scikit-learn`` is **not** required: callers that want it can plug a
custom ``scorer`` callable into :class:`FeatureDeduplicator`. The
default scorer is intentionally dependency-free so the radar runs on
the same minimal environment as the rest of ClawCodex.
