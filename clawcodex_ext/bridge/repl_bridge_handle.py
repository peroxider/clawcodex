"""Process-global pointer to the active REPL bridge handle.

Ports ``typescript/src/bridge/replBridgeHandle.ts``.

Callers outside the React tree that owns the bridge (tools, slash
commands) need a way to invoke handle methods (subscribe, send control
events, etc.). Same one-bridge-per-process justification as
``bridge_debug.ts`` — the handle's closure captures the session ID and
``get_access_token`` that created the session.

Set from the orchestrator (Phase 5/6) when init completes; cleared on
teardown. Reading is best-effort: ``None`` means no bridge is connected.

⚠️ **Phase 1 caveat — multi-peer dedup is BROKEN until Phase 2** ⚠️

The TS version calls ``utils/concurrentSessions.updateSessionBridgeId()``
on every set, which publishes the local bridge ID so other peers can
dedup. That cross-folder dep lives in Phase 2 (per refactoring plan §5
second-wave list). The Python port replaces it with a debug-logged
TODO-noop until Phase 2 lands the publisher. Operationally this means
**two concurrent Python bridges in the same workspace will not dedup
against each other** — both will appear in claude.ai/code session lists.
The public API of this module is unaffected; only the cross-process
side effect is missing.

Originally lived at ``src/bridge/repl_bridge_handle.py``; moved to
``clawcodex_ext/`` per the Decoupling Mandate. The ``src/`` shim is a
``sys.modules`` facade so ``from src.bridge.repl_bridge_handle import ...``
continues to work for the small number of legacy callers in
``extensions/`` and tests.
