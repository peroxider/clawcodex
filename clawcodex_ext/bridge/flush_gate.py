"""State machine for gating message writes during an initial flush.

Ports ``typescript/src/bridge/flushGate.ts``.

When a bridge session starts, historical messages are flushed to the
server via a single HTTP POST. During that flush, new messages must
be queued to prevent them from arriving at the server interleaved with
the historical ones.

Lifecycle:
    start()      → enqueue() returns True; items are queued
    end()        → returns queued items for draining; enqueue() returns False
    drop()       → discards queued items (permanent transport close)
    deactivate() → clears active flag without dropping queued items
                    (transport replacement — the new transport will drain
                    the pending items)

Concurrency: single-coroutine use only — concurrent ``enqueue``/``end``
calls from different asyncio tasks are undefined behavior. Asyncio +
threads is a footgun; the TS source assumes a single-threaded event loop.

Originally lived at ``src/bridge/flush_gate.py``; moved to
``clawcodex_ext/`` per the Decoupling Mandate. The ``src/`` shim is a
``sys.modules`` facade so ``from src.bridge.flush_gate import ...``
continues to work for the small number of legacy callers in
``extensions/`` and tests.
