"""Consolidation lock (with Phase B TTL enhancement).

Mirrors ``typescript/src/services/autoDream/consolidationLock.ts``.
The lock file lives in the auto-memory dir and its mtime *is*
``lastConsolidatedAt``. Body is the holder's PID. Two reclaimers
both write the same PID — last write wins; loser bails on re-read.

**Phase B (TTL 30min) — 2026-07-07**

The original Phase A implementation only counted a holder as
"alive" when (a) the PID is still running *and* (b) the mtime is
within :data:`HOLDER_STALE_MS`. The Phase B enhancement goes
further — it treats the mtime TTL as authoritative even when
the PID is alive. This closes the PID-reuse race:

* A consolidator crashes without unlinking the lock. Linux may
  recycle the PID within minutes. A second consolidator then
  sees the same PID still alive, and the old Phase A code
  refuses to reclaim — so a stale 30min+ old mtime can keep
  blocking new consolidations forever.
* Phase B lets the second consolidator forcibly reclaim the
  stale lock once mtime age ≥ :data:`HOLDER_STALE_MS`,
  regardless of holder PID liveness. The act of reclaiming
  also rewrites the mtime to *now*, which doubles as the
  ``lastConsolidatedAt`` stamp for the time gate (rolling
  forward, since we did not run the consolidation).

New APIs (all O(1) stat reads, no extra I/O):

* :func:`get_holder_pid` — lock body PID (or ``None``).
* :func:`get_lock_age_seconds` — seconds since last stamp (``0``
  = no lock file).
* :func:`is_lock_stale` — age ≥ :data:`HOLDER_STALE_MS`
  (or lock file missing → ``False``; unparseable body → ``True``).
* :func:`force_release_if_stale` — unlink stale lock; return
  whether something was actually released.

The change is **conservative** — lock files younger than
TTL still gate on PID liveness exactly as before. Reclaim of
live-PID locks only happens past TTL.

Operations:

* :func:`read_last_consolidated_at` — one stat, returns mtime ms.
* :func:`try_acquire_consolidation_lock` — write PID, return prior
  mtime for rollback or ``None`` if blocked. **TTL-aware**: stale
  holders are reclaimed even if PID is still alive.
* :func:`rollback_consolidation_lock` — rewind mtime to prior
  (or unlink if prior was 0).
* :func:`record_consolidation` — optimistic stamp for manual /dream
  (no contention check).
* :func:`list_sessions_touched_since` — session ids with mtime
  after *since_ms* (used by the session gate).
