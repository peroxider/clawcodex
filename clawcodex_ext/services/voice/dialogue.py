"""Full-duplex voice dialogue abstraction — F-65 P65-A.

Defines the interface every full-duplex voice backend (MiniMax Realtime,
OpenAI GPT-4o Voice, etc.) must implement. A full-duplex provider owns a
single bidirectional channel — usually a WebSocket — that simultaneously:

* receives PCM frames from the user microphone (``feed_audio``);
* emits incremental transcripts (``DialogueEvent(transcript, ...)``);
* emits TTS audio frames for the agent reply
  (``DialogueEvent(audio, pcm=...)``);
* accepts interrupt signals (``interrupt``) to cancel in-flight output
  without tearing down the session.

Why a separate ABC rather than reusing ``STTProvider`` / ``TTSProvider``
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MiniMax Realtime (and OpenAI Realtime) run ASR + LLM + TTS server-side
in one pipe. Pulling transcripts out of a transcript stream and pushing
text into a TTS stream would double the latency and lose the server's
VAD / turn-taking state. The single-pipe design is what makes
sub-second end-to-end response possible — so the abstraction mirrors it.
The standalone STT and TTS providers stay around as the F-64 half-duplex
/ 试听 fallback paths.

Lifecycle
---------
* :meth:`start` — open the underlying transport (WebSocket) and begin
  receiving the first ``DialogueEvent`` shortly after. Events stream
  through the ``on_event`` callback until ``stop`` is called.
* :meth:`feed_audio` — push PCM frames the user is currently saying.
  Non-blocking: returns after queueing the frame (the wire protocol
  task dispatches it on the event loop).
* :meth:`send_text` — inject a text message (e.g. an agent reply
  produced by an external LLM call) into the same conversation.
  Optional; some deployments only use server-side LLM.
* :meth:`interrupt` — user barges in. Cancels any in-flight TTS on the
  server side and stops local playback. The session stays open.
* :meth:`stop` — graceful shutdown: tell the server to flush its
  buffers, then disconnect. Returns the final transcript / summary.
* :meth:`close` — release resources (cancel tasks, close socket).
  Called automatically by ``stop``; not always needed by callers.
