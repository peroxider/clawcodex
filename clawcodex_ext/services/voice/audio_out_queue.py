"""Async audio output queue — F-64 P64-E8.

The mirror of :class:`AudioChunkQueue` (P64-C) for the playback direction.
A TTS provider's background task *pushes* decoded PCM frames as they
arrive from the backend; a player thread *pulls* frames at the device's
realtime pace. The queue bridges the two timing domains without buffering
the whole clip in memory or stalling the provider on a slow device.

Why a separate class from ``AudioChunkQueue``
---------------------------------------------
The STT queue's single-slot design assumes the consumer (the WebSocket
pump) drains frames faster than the recorder produces them — true for
16 kHz mono PCM over a fast network. TTS playback is *clocked* by the
audio device: the player thread blocks on ``pyaudio.write`` for the
frame's real duration (e.g. 20ms per 320-sample frame at 16 kHz), so
the provider can easily out-produce the device. We therefore keep a
small bounded buffer (default 50 frames ≈ 1s of audio at 20ms/frame)
and drop the oldest frame on overflow rather than blocking the provider
task — a dropped TTS frame is a brief glitch, far better than stalling
the agent-reply pipeline.

End-of-stream is signalled by pushing a :class:`TTSChunk` with
``is_final=True``; the player drains the buffer then releases the device.
