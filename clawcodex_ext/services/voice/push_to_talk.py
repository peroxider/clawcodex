"""Push-to-Talk controller — F-64 P64-B.

Mirrors TS ``src/hooks/useVoice.ts``: orchestrates the recording lifecycle
on a push-to-talk key event. The user holds a key (default: spacebar,
configured by the REPL/TUI); on press we start recording + open the STT
stream, on release we stop recording + await the final transcript.

Lifecycle
---------
1. :meth:`start` — arm the controller. Resolves the active provider from
   settings, instantiates it via the registry, opens a
   ``VoiceStreamConnection`` / ``DoubaoStreamConnection``, and starts the
   :class:`AudioRecorder`. The recorder thread pushes PCM frames into the
   connection's :class:`AudioChunkQueue`.
2. Interim transcripts arrive on the ``on_transcript`` callback during
   recording — the REPL/TUI renders them as live ghost text.
3. :meth:`stop` — user released the key. Stop the recorder, call
   ``finalize()`` on the connection (Anthropic blocks until the server
   emits the final transcript; doubao returns immediately), and return
   the final text for the REPL to insert + auto-submit.

Surface-agnostic
----------------
The controller is deliberately decoupled from the UI layer: it exposes
``on_transcript`` / ``on_error`` callbacks and a ``state`` property. The
REPL/TUI wires the push-to-talk hotkey → :meth:`start` / :meth:`stop` and
renders ``state`` + interim transcripts however it likes. This keeps the
voice stack testable without a real terminal.

Concurrency
-----------
``start`` / ``stop`` are *not* async — they're called from the UI thread
on a key event. The async connection machinery runs on the event loop
the controller binds at ``start`` time (the REPL's running loop). The
recorder runs on its own daemon thread and pushes into the thread-safe
:class:`AudioChunkQueue`.
