"""Interrupt detector — F-65 P65-B.

Watches an inbound PCM stream for *barge-in*: the user starts speaking
while the agent is mid-reply. Triggered by a sustained rise in audio
energy above a configurable threshold, with a debounce window so a
single noisy frame doesn't kill a fresh reply.

The detector is intentionally simple — energy-based VAD on rolling PCM
windows. The F-64 :class:`VoiceActivityDetector` in :mod:`detection`
already does this for the speech/state machine; rather than wrap that
class (which is session-lifecycle-coupled via ``start`` / ``stop``),
:Class:`InterruptDetector` keeps its own numeric state and exposes
only the one decision the dialogue session manager needs:

> "Did the user just start speaking in a way that should cancel the
> agent reply?"

Design choices
--------------
* **Per-call, not event-streamed** — :meth:`feed_pcm` accepts a single
  PCM frame and returns the current decision (``"silence"`` /
  ``"speech_start"`` / ``"speaking"`` / ``"speech_stop"``). The session
  manager drives it from its existing audio-recording loop; no
  callbacks needed. Keeping the API "call me once per frame" means
  tests don't have to wrestle with async listener plumbing.
* **Energy, not ML** — RMS in dBFS against a configurable threshold,
  averaged over the last ``window_ms`` of frames. Good enough for the
  barge-in trigger (sensitivity tuning lives in
  :class:`InterruptConfig`, no model weights required). A real Silero
  VAD would be a drop-in replacement once we add it.
* **Half-duplex aware** — when the agent isn't speaking (nothing to
  barge into) the detector still works fine; the session manager simply
  ignores its decisions. Skipping the work entirely would couple the
  detector to session state we don't want to know about here.
* **Cooldown after a trigger** — prevents flapping at the speech edge
  if the user's first frame is borderline energy; configurable.
