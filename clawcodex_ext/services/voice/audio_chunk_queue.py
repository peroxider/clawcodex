"""Async audio chunk queue — F-64 P64-C.

Mirrors TS ``src/services/doubaoSTT.ts`` ``AudioChunkQueue``: a push-style
async queue that bridges a *push* audio producer (the recorder thread) to a
*pull* async consumer (the STT streaming connection's ``AsyncIterable``
contract).

Why this exists
---------------
The Anthropic and doubao STT backends both expose an
``AsyncIterable[bytes]`` audio source: ``async for chunk in source``. But
audio capture (PyAudio / SoX) runs in a synchronous thread that *pushes*
frames as they arrive. ``AudioChunkQueue`` reconciles the two directions
without buffering the whole recording in memory:

* The producer thread calls :meth:`push` for each PCM frame.
* The consumer task iterates the queue with ``async for``; each iteration
  awaits until a frame is available.
* The producer signals end-of-stream with :meth:`push`(``None``); the
  consumer's ``async for`` then terminates cleanly.

The implementation uses a single-slot "waiting future" rather than
``asyncio.Queue`` to keep latency at one frame (no queue depth buildup)
and to keep the surface tiny — this is a hot audio path and we don't want
backpressure surprises. If the consumer is slow, frames are dropped with a
debug log; for 16 kHz mono PCM that's a 32 KB/s stream and a single
awaitable slot is more than enough headroom.

    Single-slot design: at most one waiting consumer and one buffered

    ``async for`` then stops iteration after draining the buffer.

    Thread-safety: :meth:`push` is safe to call from a non-asyncio thread
    (the audio recorder thread) — it uses :meth:`loop.call_soon_threadsafe`
    to schedule the wake-up. The consumer side must run on the same loop.
