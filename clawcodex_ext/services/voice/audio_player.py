"""Cross-platform PCM audio player.

Plays mono PCM16 bytes through the system audio device. Three backends
with graceful fallback (mirrors :mod:`audio_recorder`'s PyAudio→SoX
strategy):

1. **PyAudio** (preferred) — opens a blocking stream and writes frames
   at the device's realtime pace. Lowest latency, but PyAudio install
   is the most fragile across distros.
2. **SoX** ``play`` — pipes PCM via stdin; available on most macOS/Linux
   installs without a Python build toolchain.
3. **ffplay** (fallback / 试听 path) — writes the PCM to a temp WAV and
   plays it once. Highest latency (process spawn + file I/O) but the
   most universally available (bundled with ffmpeg). Used by the
   ``/tts say`` 试听 path when neither PyAudio nor SoX is present.

The ``play_pcm(pcm, sample_rate=...)`` convenience function tries the
backends in order and raises ``RuntimeError`` if none are available —
the ``/tts`` command surfaces this as a clear "install pyaudio / sox /
ffmpeg" message.

Design
------
* :class:`AudioPlayer` — streaming player backed by :class:`AudioOutQueue`
  (provider pushes frames, player drains at device pace). Used by the
  agent-reply path (P64-E9 future).
* :func:`play_pcm` — one-shot batch player for the 试听 command. Writes
  the whole clip to the device; no queueing. Simpler and good enough
  for a few seconds of audio.
