"""Factory entry point that builds a Computer Use provider suite.

The factory is intentionally a thin shim. It does *not* import the
``clawcodex_ext.tool_system`` Tool type so that this package can be used in
unit tests and in environments where the Tool factory is not available. The
deferred integration will be wired
in a later iteration.
