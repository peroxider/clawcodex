"""Built-in default templates (P85-E).

P85-E ships a small, opinionated set of canonical templates that every
install starts with. The set mirrors the built-in agents in
:mod:`src.agent.agent_definitions` so users have a familiar starting
point: an agent that says ``template: explore`` should behave the same
as spawning the built-in :data:`~src.agent.agent_definitions.EXPLORE_AGENT`.

The set is intentionally narrow:

* ``general-purpose`` — full tool access; the default for ad-hoc work.
* ``explore`` — read-only file-search agent (no Edit/Write/Bash).
* ``plan`` — read-only architect agent; inherits the parent model.
* ``fix`` — full tools + a bounded turn budget, suited for bug-fix loops.
* ``review`` — read-only + a larger turn budget for code-review passes.

Storage strategy — **Python data, not YAML**. The five templates are
constants, not user-editable, so they live as :class:`Template`
dataclass instances rather than as ``*.yml`` files shipped alongside
the code. That keeps the import graph clean (no PyYAML required to
materialise defaults) and makes the templates inspectable from
Python without a filesystem round-trip.

Source label — ``SOURCE_BUILT_IN = "built-in"`` matches the
:class:`~src.agent.agent_definitions.AgentSource` literal so the
``/template list --source built-in`` filter works the same way users
expect from ``/agent list``.

Precedence — built-ins register **first** inside
:func:`~src.services.templates.bootstrap.bootstrap_default_templates`,
then user / project / managed layers can overwrite them. That way
"a user template named ``plan``" wins automatically without any code
change; no flag is required to shadow a built-in.
