"""Telemetry shutdown-flush lifecycle hooks.

Registers a :func:`src.utils.graceful_shutdown.register_cleanup` callback
that flushes the telemetry recorder (aggregate + reporter emit) on process
exit — via SIGINT, SIGTERM, or normal ``atexit``.

This is a best-effort, fire-and-forget hook. If telemetry is disabled or
the recorder has not been initialized, the cleanup is a no-op.

The flush is run in a short-lived daemon thread so a slow HTTP request
to the remote Issue tracker never blocks the process exit. If the thread
does not finish before the interpreter shuts down, it is silently killed.

Usage
-----
Called lazily from ``src/init.py:init()``, after the exception hooks and
the nested-transcript resolver have been installed::

    from clawcodex_ext.telemetry_lifecycle import install_telemetry_shutdown_flush
    install_telemetry_shutdown_flush()

Idempotent — calling it more than once is safe (second call is a no-op).
