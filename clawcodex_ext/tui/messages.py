"""Textual ``Message`` subclasses used to push events from the agent-loop
worker thread (and other background tasks) into the UI.

All cross-thread communication between the worker that drives
``src.query.agent_loop_compat.run_query_as_agent_loop`` and the
Textual widgets goes through these messages via ``App.post_message``.
Keeping the
payload primitive-only (``str``, ``dict``, ``bool``, ``set[str]``)
ensures Textual's message pump can marshal them safely across the
thread boundary.

Naming conventions mirror the React side:

* ``AgentRunStarted`` / ``AgentRunFinished`` — turn bracketing.
* ``AssistantChunk`` — a streamed assistant token batch
  (`handleMessageFromStream` counterpart).
* ``AssistantMessage`` — the fully-assembled assistant turn at end-of-turn.
* ``ToolEventMessage`` — proxies :class:`src.tool_system.renderers.ToolEvent`.
* ``PermissionRequested`` / ``PermissionResolved`` — gate-in / gate-out
  for the permission modal (Phase 1 of the ink :class:`PermissionRequest`
  overlay parity).
* ``StateChanged`` — a coarse "something in :class:`AppState` changed"
  signal used by status / transcript widgets that bind to many fields
  at once (we coalesce instead of emitting one message per field).
