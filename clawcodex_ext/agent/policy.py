"""Shared identity and action-norm primitives for custom agents.

This module is the single place to change the wording of "what kind of
agent you are" and "what you must/must not do" for the agents shipped
under ``clawcodex_ext``. Extension authors compose new agents by
picking an ``IDENTITY_*`` template, one or more ``NORM_*`` action
norms, and any number of ``TOOL_SET_*`` presets, then assemble the
final system prompt with :func:`build_agent_prompt`.

The intent is to mirror how ``_SHARED_PREFIX`` and
``_SHARED_GUIDELINES`` are used inside
``src/agent/agent_definitions.py`` for the built-in agents, but
expose them as named, importable constants so downstream authors do
not have to copy-paste private strings.

- Modifying existing files (no Edit operations)
- Deleting files (no rm or deletion)
- Moving or copying files (no mv or cp)
- Creating temporary files anywhere, including /tmp
- Using redirect operators (>, >>, |) or heredocs to write to files
- Running ANY commands that change system state

When writing or modifying code:

- Match the surrounding code's style, naming, and module boundaries.
- Do not add features beyond what was asked.
- Do not introduce speculative abstractions — three similar lines beat
  a premature helper.

  not change.
- Run the existing test suite (or a focused subset) before reporting
  the task as done.

When researching online:

When working with git:

  style suggestions.
- When suggesting a fix, provide a minimal patch rather than prose.
