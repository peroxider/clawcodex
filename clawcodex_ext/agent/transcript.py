"""Sidechain JSONL transcript writer + reader — Chunk C / WI-2.2.

**This is gate-zero for Chunk D and Chunk F.** Without on-disk transcript
persistence:

* Chapter §"Background: Three Channels" can't expose ``outputFile`` /
  ``outputOffset`` to ``TaskOutput`` (Chunk D / WI-3.1 / gap #7).
* Chapter §"Auto-Resume Pattern" can't reconstruct the conversation
  history from disk (Chunk F / WI-7.4 / gap #10).

Both depend on a JSONL file at a stable path containing one JSON object
per ``Message`` the agent produced. This module is the single source of
truth for that path and that file format.

Format
------

JSONL — one JSON object per line, encoded as UTF-8, terminated with
``\\n``. Per assumption A4 (gap-analysis ambiguity #4): the trade-offs
are atomic appends without an external lock library at the cost of
losing "read whole inbox in one parse." The reader is tolerant of a
trailing partial line (writer-crashed-mid-write case) — it logs once
and skips.

Concurrency
-----------

Writes go through ``os.write`` on an ``O_APPEND`` file descriptor. POSIX
guarantees ``write()`` calls of size ≤ ``PIPE_BUF`` (typically 4096
bytes) are atomic with respect to other writers; for a single agent
producing one line per Message, lines stay well under that and
interleaving cannot occur. Lines >4 KiB *can* interleave under heavy
concurrency; the reader's tolerant parser absorbs the resulting partial
line. Documented as a known limitation; a future revision could move to
``filelock`` if the >4 KiB regime becomes routine.

Out of scope (per critic concern C4 / Phase 11 follow-up)
---------------------------------------------------------

GC / rotation / age-based eviction. Transcripts grow unbounded under
this WI; the chapter-11 follow-up ticket will land a cleanup policy.
This module DOES expose ``get_agent_transcript_path`` / ``ensure_transcript_dir``
so the future GC has a stable target to walk.
