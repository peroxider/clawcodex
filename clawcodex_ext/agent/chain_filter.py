"""F-103 chain filter — parentUuid chain walker and byte-level pruner.

This module is the read-side counterpart of F-103. The write side lives
in :mod:`extensions.agent.session_persist` (``_inject_parent_uuids``).

Design (mirrors docs/FEATURE_PLAN.md §1.4.6):

    transcript.jsonl
        ↓ (raw bytes)
    walk_chain_before_parse()
        ↓ (filtered bytes — dead branches dropped)
    json.loads per line
        ↓ (message dicts)
    build_conversation_chain()
        ↓ (ordered active-chain messages)
    Session.load() / resume()

Why byte-level pruning:

    Per CCB architecture, ``walkChainBeforeParse`` scans the raw
    transcript for the substring ``"parentUuid":`` to build a uuid
    index **without** parsing each JSON line. This keeps the cost
    of the filter proportional to dead-branch size, not to
    conversation size, on long histories where most rewinds /
    forks are noise.

Two-stage gating:

    * ``DEAD_BRANCH_RATIO`` — skip filtering when < 50% of lines are
      off the active chain. Rationale: small sessions are fast
      enough to parse in full, and the byte scan itself is wasted
      work below this threshold.
    * ``ABS_SIZE_THRESHOLD`` — skip filtering on transcripts
      smaller than 10 KB. Same rationale: tiny transcripts benefit
      more from direct ``json.loads`` than from byte scanning.

Backward compatibility:

    Transcripts without any ``"parentUuid":`` substring (legacy
    sessions written before F-103) skip the filter automatically
    — the gate fires on byte-index sparsity, not on schema
    version, so no explicit feature flag is needed.

Decoupling:

    This module imports no project internals from ``src/`` and no
    SessionStorage / Conversation glue. It operates on ``bytes``
    and ``list[dict]`` exclusively, so it can be unit-tested in
    isolation and reused by Visualizer / Telemetry consumers if
    they decide to honour the active-chain view too.
