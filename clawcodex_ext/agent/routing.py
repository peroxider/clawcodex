"""F-88 P88-C — prompt-to-subagent-type classifier.

When the Agent tool is invoked without an explicit ``subagent_type``,
this module decides whether the user's prompt semantically points at
the Explore or Plan one-shot agents, or should fall through to
``general-purpose``.

The classifier is a pure function — no I/O, no LLM call, no
side-effects. It runs on every Agent-tool invocation, so it must be
fast (sub-millisecond) and deterministic.

Phrase tables
-------------
The two tables below are the source of truth for routing. Each entry
is a substring matched (case-insensitively) against the user's
prompt. We use substrings (not whole-word regex) for two reasons:

1. The intent phrase in natural language rarely has clean word
   boundaries. "find all the python files" contains "find all" as a
   substring and the user almost certainly means Explore; a
   whole-word match would miss it.
2. The table is small (40 entries total) and the prompts are short
   (≤ 1 KB), so the O(n*m) cost is irrelevant.

Tie-breaking
------------
If both tables score > 0, the higher score wins. Ties go to Plan.
The reasoning: a planning request is a stronger signal than an
exploration request because the user is committing to "act on this";
they can always issue a follow-up Explore with a more focused
prompt. The Plan-tie-break is a deliberate product call — debate
is deferrable, the user can override with explicit
``subagent_type``.
