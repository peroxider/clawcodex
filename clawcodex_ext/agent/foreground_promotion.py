"""Foreground → background agent promotion — Chunk H / WI-10.1.

Mirrors the ``Promise.race`` pattern in
``typescript/src/tasks/LocalAgentTask/LocalAgentTask.tsx:519-651``.
The TS sync agent loop races "next message from agent" against
"background signal"; on the bg-signal branch it cleanly returns the
foreground iterator (triggering its ``finally`` for resource cleanup)
and re-spawns the agent as async.

Python equivalent: ``asyncio.wait({next_msg_task, bg_signal_task},
return_when=FIRST_COMPLETED)`` — see the `Promise.race` direct
translation. ``gather`` would wait for both, which is wrong.

The chapter calls out four abort scenarios that have to behave
correctly:

* **Foreground ESC** — kills both the agent and its parent (shared
  abort controller).
* **Background ESC after promotion** — kills only the background
  agent; the parent (now wholly separate) is unaffected.
* **Background signal during foreground** — promotion: foreground
  iterator returns cleanly, background spawn with same agent_id,
  abort controllers swap, ``is_backgrounded`` flips True.
* **Background signal during background** — no-op; the agent is
  already backgrounded.

Atomicity contract: no messages lost in the transition; no zombie
iterators left running. The ``asyncio.wait`` pattern enforces this
because the unfinished task is explicitly cancelled in the bg-signal
branch.

Per A6/C5: the promotion mutator (which flips ``is_backgrounded`` on
``LocalAgentTaskState``) is sync — runs under ``runtime_tasks.update``
without ``await``. The actual asyncio races happen *outside* the
registry lock.
