"""F-125 C9: read-file-state seed for headless resume.

When a session is resumed via ``--resume`` / ``--fork-session``, the
conversation history carries ``tool_use`` blocks for prior ``Read``
calls. Without re-seeding ``tool_context.read_file_fingerprints``, the
``Edit`` / ``Write`` / ``NotebookEdit`` staleness checks
(``was_file_read_and_unchanged``) cannot tell that the model already
"knows" a file — they will reject edits with "file must be read first",
and the dedup path in ``Read`` cannot collapse re-reads to
``file_unchanged``.

Upstream CCB solves this with ``extractReadFilesFromMessages`` at
``print.ts:1173-1176``. This module is the Python analog: it walks the
resumed conversation's content blocks, finds every ``tool_use`` whose
``name == "Read"`` with a ``file_path`` argument that still exists on
disk, and calls ``context.mark_file_read(path)`` so the fingerprint
cache reflects the file's current mtime/size.

Design notes
------------
* **Pairing not required**: a ``tool_use`` alone is sufficient evidence
  the model read the file — the corresponding ``tool_result`` only
  carries the content snapshot, not the disk fingerprint. We seed from
  ``tool_use`` blocks directly.
* **Partial reads**: when the historical Read used ``offset`` / ``limit``
  we mark the file partial so the dedup path won't falsely collapse a
  later full read.
* **Missing files**: silently skipped. The file may have been deleted
  between runs; re-reading it would have failed anyway.
* **Best-effort**: any error is swallowed and logged at debug level —
  seeding is an optimisation, not a correctness gate. The agent can
  always re-Read explicitly.
* **Return value**: the number of files seeded, for telemetry / tests.

    """Populate ``context.read_file_fingerprints`` from historical Read calls.

    Walks ``messages`` (any object exposing ``.role`` / ``.content`` or
    a ``dict`` with the same shape), finds ``Read`` ``tool_use`` blocks,
    and marks the referenced files as read on ``context`` so subsequent
    Edit/Write staleness checks and Read dedup behave as if the model
    had just read them in this session.

    Parameters
    ----------
    messages
        The resumed conversation's message iterable. Each message may
        be a dataclass with a ``content`` attribute (list of blocks) or
        a ``dict`` with a ``"content"`` key.
    context
        A :class:`src.tool_system.context.ToolContext` (or compatible)
        exposing ``mark_file_read(path, *, partial=False)`` and
        ``read_file_fingerprints``.
    workspace_root
        Used to resolve relative ``file_path`` arguments. When ``None``,
        only absolute paths are seeded.

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The number of files successfully seeded (silently skips files
        that don't exist or fail to stat).
