"""Capabilities bridge — re-exports from extensions.capabilities.

This module exists so adapter modules in ``clawcodex_ext/`` can import
from a stable path without depending directly on ``extensions/``
internal structure.  All definitions live in
``extensions/capabilities/adapter_protocol.py``.
