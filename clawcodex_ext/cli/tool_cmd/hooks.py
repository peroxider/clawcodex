"""Registration hooks for F-53.

This module glues F-53 to the two existing command surfaces:

1. **CLI argv level** (:mod:`clawcodex_ext.cli.subcommand_registry`):
   A single ``tool`` subcommand is registered that dispatches to any
   discoverable tool by name. See :mod:`clawcodex_ext.cli.tool_cmd.runtime`.

2. **REPL/TUI level** (:mod:`clawcodex_ext.command_system.registry`):
   Individual :class:`LocalCommand` objects are registered for each
   discoverable tool, so the user can invoke ``/detect_modality …`` in
   the REPL. See :func:`register_tool_commands` below.

The CLI hook is wired from ``subcommand_registry.load_builtin_subcommands``
(per the F-53 spec §1.6). The REPL/TUI hook is exposed as a public
function and called from the REPL/TUI startup code in the same place
``register_runtime_commands`` is called.
