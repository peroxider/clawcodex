"""Print 'Resume this session with: clawcodex --resume <sid>' on exit.

Mirrors CCB's ``printResumeHint()`` (typescript/src/utils/gracefulShutdown.ts
L141-176). Centralised so the REPL, TUI upstream/downstream, and headless
text mode all share one implementation.

Gating rules (from FEATURE_PLAN §6.2.1):
  * Skip when ``session_id`` is empty (transient / non-resumable runs).
  * Skip when the stream is not a TTY (don't pollute piped output,
    machine-readable JSON, or stream-json consumers — those paths
    already carry the session id in their structured payload via
    ResultEvent.session_id / NDJSON ``session_id`` field).

Idempotency
-----------
``print_resume_hint`` is **process-wide idempotent**: the first call that
passes the gates flips a module-level latch and subsequent calls in the
same process are no-ops. This protects against the S-R1 double-print
scenario where two code paths both fire the hint — e.g. the REPL ``/exit``
inline print at ``repl/core.py:4746`` and the atexit cleanup registered
by ``frontend/repl_extensions.py:_register_signal_session_save``. With
the latch, the hint is emitted exactly once per process.
