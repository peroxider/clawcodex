"""Pending-notification queue for parent-agent injection — Chunk D / WI-3.1.

Mirrors the ``messageQueueManager`` surface in
``typescript/src/utils/messageQueueManager.ts``. Notifications enqueued
here are drained at the next tool-round boundary (or by an explicit
caller) and surfaced as user-role messages in the parent agent's
conversation. The chapter calls these out as the "task notifications"
channel — the parent sees them in its normal message flow without a
special tool to poll.

The queue is process-global (one per Python process) for parity with
the TS module-singleton shape. A single ``threading.RLock`` guards the
deque; reads and writes are short.

Originally lived at ``src/utils/message_queue_manager.py``; moved to
``clawcodex_ext/`` per the Decoupling Mandate. The ``src/`` shim is a
``sys.modules`` facade so ``from src.utils.message_queue_manager import
...`` continues to work for the small number of legacy callers in
``extensions/`` and tests.
