"""Cache warning module with LRU eviction for memory safety.

This module provides a CacheWarning class that maintains a bounded cache of
cache warning states by source, with automatic eviction of the oldest entry
when the cache reaches capacity.

Designed to prevent memory leaks in long-running daemon/swarm sessions where
querySource might be typed as `any`, producing many unique source values.
