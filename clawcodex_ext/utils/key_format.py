"""Normalize and display the ghost-suggestion accept key.

The REPL uses prompt_toolkit (which registers bindings as ``"c-e"``,
``"tab"``, ``"c-j"`` …) and the TUI uses Textual (which dispatches
``on_key`` with ``event.key`` strings like ``"ctrl+e"``, ``"tab"``,
``"ctrl+j"``). They share a single user-configurable key but speak two
dialects, so this module is the single place that translates between
them and renders a human-readable form for the ghost-text hint.

The canonical on-disk form is prompt_toolkit's (e.g. ``"c-e"``). That
keeps the on-disk setting close to the upstream
``AutoSuggestFromHistory`` accept key and matches what most REPL users
have seen in documentation.
