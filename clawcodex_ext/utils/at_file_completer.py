"""``@`` file-mention completer for the REPL's prompt and live input.

Mirrors the TS Ink reference's ``@``-mention behavior
(``typescript/src/hooks/fileSuggestions.ts`` +
``typescript/src/hooks/useTypeahead.tsx``):

* Trigger on ``@`` at the start of a token (preceded by whitespace or
  beginning-of-line). The token after ``@`` is matched against a cached
  list of project files; matches are offered as completions that
  replace ``@<query>`` with ``@<path>`` in the buffer.
* The candidate list comes from ``git ls-files`` when the working
  directory sits inside a git repo (fast, gitignore-aware via git
  itself); otherwise we fall back to a bounded ``os.walk`` that skips
  the obvious heavyweight directories (``.git``, ``node_modules``,
  ``__pycache__`` …).
* Empty query (``@`` with nothing after) lists the top of the candidate
  set so the popup appears immediately on ``@``, matching the TS
  ``showOnEmpty`` path.
* The cache is rebuilt on a 5-second floor — short enough to pick up
  newly-created files in a typing session without spawning a git
  subprocess on every keystroke.

The class is intentionally framework-agnostic: it implements
``prompt_toolkit.completion.Completer`` so the same instance can plug
into the idle ``PromptSession`` and the live ``LiveStatus`` input
buffer used while the agent is working.
