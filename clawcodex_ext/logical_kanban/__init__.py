"""Compatibility shim — re-export from lkb standalone package.

This module is kept for backward compatibility. All logical_kanban functionality
now lives in the ``lkb`` package at ``extensions/lkb/src/lkb/``.

New code should import directly from ``lkb``:
    from lkb import TaskDecomposer, LogicalKanbanService, ...

Feature flags are registered by ``clawcodex_ext/logical_kanban/flags.py`` shim
(which delegates to ``lkb.flags`` with ``clawcodex_ext.feature_gate`` registration).
