"""Shared worker-thread + queue-poll stream drain for cancel latency.

Both :class:`ClawcodexAnthropicProvider` and
:class:`ClawcodexMinimaxProvider` (and the upstream
``openai_compatible.py``) wrap the Anthropic / OpenAI SDK's
``messages.stream`` context manager, whose ``text_stream`` is a
synchronous generator backed by a blocking httpx socket read.

``response.close()`` from the keypress thread is best-effort: on
some platforms and LiteLLM-proxied connections the blocking read
does NOT return when the response is closed, and the user would
otherwise wait the full HTTP read timeout (~60s) before a Shift+Tab
or Ctrl+C cancel lands.

This module hoists the synchronous iteration onto a daemon worker
thread and lets the main thread poll a queue with a 100ms timeout,
re-checking the abort guard on every tick. Cancel latency is
bounded to ~100ms regardless of whether the underlying socket close
is honored — the same pattern that ``openai_compatible.py:622-660``
ships with.

            generator (Anthropic / Minimax SDK ``MessageStream``).
        guard: :class:`StreamAbortGuard` wrapping the cancel signal.
            ``guard.aborted`` is checked on every queue-poll tick; on
            True we call ``guard.raise_if_post_aborted()`` so the
            controller's abort reason (``"user_interrupt"`` etc.) is
            preserved.
        on_text: Optional callback invoked once per non-empty chunk.
            Runs on the **main** thread, not the worker.
        watchdog: Optional :class:`StreamWatchdog`; ``reset()`` is
            called on every delivered chunk so the idle deadline only
            fires when the stream genuinely stalls.
        stream_name: Used in the worker thread's ``name`` attribute
            for debuggability (e.g. ``anthropic-stream-140234``).

    Returns:
        None. Raises ``AbortError`` (via ``guard``) on user cancel,
        or re-raises any exception surfaced by the underlying
        ``text_stream`` generator (network errors, SDK errors, etc.).
