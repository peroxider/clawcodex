"""Prompt construction for Away Summary.

Two distinct instruction templates are maintained, mirroring the
canonical Claude Code split between the *automatic* "while you were away"
card and the *manual* ``/recap`` command. The automatic variant is
slightly more relaxed (1-3 sentences, narrative-style) so the prompt-card
reads naturally when shown alongside the transcript; the manual variant
is strict (1-2 sentences, three-part structure) so a user who types
``/recap`` gets a tight recap they can scan in one breath.

AWAY_SUMMARY_INSTRUCTIONS = """The user stepped away from an interactive coding session and is coming back. Write a brief, natural session recap.

Format:
- 1-2 short, flowing sentences that name the high-level goal and where things stand.
- Then add a short bullet list (1-3 items) with whatever context matters most: the most useful next action, files touched, tools used, or anything else the user needs to pick up quickly.
- On the line immediately before the bullet list, add ONE short phrase that explains the intent of the bullets. Use a plain phrase, not a label ending in a colon. Examples: `后续计划` / `后续步骤` / `Next steps` / `What next` / `To wrap up`. Do NOT use a colon.
- Use `-` as the bullet marker for both English and Chinese.
- Use plain text only. Do NOT use fixed section labels (e.g. labels ending in a colon that name a category). Let the bullets speak for themselves.
- No headings, no bold, no markdown beyond the bullet markers.
- Under 60 words (English) / 90 Chinese characters (中文).

Content guidance (consider these dimensions, but do not label them):
- High-level goal: what the user is building or debugging, NOT implementation details.
- Where they left off: the last meaningful state.
- The single most useful next action.
- Files touched or tools used by the assistant, if any.

Example:
We're debugging why away-summary messages now render in white with less content compared to the earlier light-gray, fuller recaps. The assistant inspected tui/screens/repl.py and confirmed the muted style is still applied.
- 后续计划
- tui/screens/repl.py
- Read(tui/screens/repl.py), Grep
- Compare the fallback formatter against the earlier structured-label version.

{language_instruction}

Rules:
- The recap MUST be written in the language specified above. Do not switch languages mid-recap.
- The first sentence should sound like a handoff, not a status report.
- Do NOT start the recap with a preamble such as "你刚回来，这是之前的会话摘要：", "Here's a summary:", or any meta-introduction about what the text is.
- Use `-` and ONLY `-` as the bullet marker. Do NOT use `•`, `*`, `·`, or numbered bullets.
- Do NOT add a heading or label before the bullet list; only the single intent phrase is allowed, and it must NOT end with a colon.
- Skip root-cause narrative, internal fix details, secondary to-dos, and em-dash tangents.
- Do not mention that you are an AI.
- Do NOT output any internal chain-of-thought, planning notes, or self-checks
  — even if your prompt normally does so. In particular:
    * Never start your reply with "Here's a thinking process", "思考过程:",
      "Thinking process:", "Let me think", or any similar preamble.
    * Never enclose the recap in <think>…</think>, <thinking>…</thinking>, or
      any other reasoning tags.
    * Never include numbered "step 1: analyze, step 2: identify, step 3:
      draft, step 4: check constraints" self-audit scaffolding.
- Return only the recap."""
