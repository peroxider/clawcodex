"""WebSocket client for ``/v1/sessions/ws/{id}/subscribe`` (claude.ai → CCR).

Ports ``typescript/src/remote/SessionsWebSocket.ts:82-404``.

Reconnection strategy is **discriminated by close code** (per chapter
§"Remote Session Management"):

  - **4003 (unauthorized)**: stop immediately. Permanent rejection.
  - **4001 (session not found)**: max 3 retries with linear backoff
    (transient during compaction).
  - **other transient**: max 5 attempts with constant-delay retry
    (``RECONNECT_DELAY_SECONDS = 2.0``). [chapter, unverified: chapter
    says "exponential backoff", but the actual TS code uses a constant
    2 s delay; we match the code.]

Per Risk #22 in the refactoring plan: the ``websockets`` library does
NOT auto-reconnect (unlike JS WebSocket event handlers). We implement
an explicit reconnect loop with the discriminated retry strategy.

Lifecycle state machine (round-2): the WS lives in one of three states
— ``closed``, ``connecting``, ``connected``. ``connecting`` exists
purely to make ``connect()`` single-flight; ``connected`` gates the
send paths. Mirrors TS ``WebSocketState`` at
``SessionsWebSocket.ts:38``. A separate ``_user_disconnected`` latch
distinguishes a *transient* closed state (waiting on a budgeted
reconnect timer) from a *permanent* closed state (user called
``disconnect()``).
