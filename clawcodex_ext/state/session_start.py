"""Session-start wiring helpers.

Phase 3.2 of the ch03 state refactor: wires the latching
``evaluate_prompt_cache_1h_eligibility`` writer from a session-start
entry point.

This is a thin shim because the real inputs (is_ant_user, is_subscriber,
is_using_overage) come from the auth/subscription subsystem, which is its
own porting WI. Until that lands, the inputs default to False — yielding
``latch=False`` and keeping 1h caching dormant. The advantage of wiring
the call now (rather than later) is that the latch transitions from
``None`` to ``False`` at session start: subsequent calls to
``should_1h_cache_ttl`` see a settled value and don't race the writer.

When the auth subsystem lands, replace ``_read_auth_signals()`` with a
real reader (or pass the signals in as args from the entry point that
has them). The latch is one-shot, so the wiring is wrong only if the
auth signals aren't available *before* the first API call — at which
point the writer would need to be invoked earlier.

Call this from your application's session-start entry point (the
equivalent of TS's API-client init path). Today the recommended call
site is the REPL/TUI bootstrap, after settings have been loaded.
