"""Sticky-on header/parameter latches for prompt-cache stability.

Mirrors TS ``bootstrap/state.ts:225,229,233,237,242`` (the five latch field
declarations) and ``bootstrap/state.ts:1738-1787`` (their getters/setters/
reset). Five toggle latches plus a 1h-eligibility evaluation primitive plus
a query-source allowlist control whether each request emits
``cache_control: {ttl: '5m' | '1h'}``.

Why latches at all (per chapter §"Sticky Latch Fields"): each of these five
fields, if flipped mid-session, would bust ~50-70K tokens of cached prompt.
Sacrificing mid-session toggleability buys cache stability worth far more in
dollars per turn.

Per the Phase 2 audit (M9-resolved):
  * ``prompt_cache_1h_eligible`` — wired here; consumed by WI-2.2's
    ``should_1h_cache_ttl`` selector.
  * ``fast_mode_header_latched`` — wired by ``src/utils/fast_mode.py`` on
    first true result of ``is_fast_mode_enabled()``.
  * ``afk_mode_header_latched`` — DEAD STORE today (no AFK toggle in
    Python TUI yet). Future TUI WI must add the trigger.
  * ``cache_editing_header_latched`` — DEAD STORE today (cache-editing is
    a TS GrowthBook treatment with no Python equivalent yet).
  * ``thinking_clear_latched`` — DEAD STORE today (thinking-mode-flip event
    is not exposed by ``src/utils/effort.py`` in the form needed for this
    latch). Future WI must surface the event.

    "evaluated to False" — only the former triggers a fresh evaluation.

    Inputs:
      - ``is_ant_user``: TS ``process.env.USER_TYPE === 'ant'``. Python
        equivalent does not exist yet; callers default to ``False`` until
        a porting WI lands. (Per critic R3.)

    Default-False inputs yield ``latch=False`` — the safe default that
    keeps 1h caching dormant. When the porting WI for these inputs lands,
    1h caching activates without requiring code changes here.

    **Status (ch03 round-3 refresh):** this primitive IS called by

    itself has zero callers. The 1h cache path is therefore still
    end-to-end dormant: ``prompt_cache_1h_eligible`` stays at ``None``,
    ``should_1h_cache_ttl`` always returns False, every cache_control
    emits ``ttl: '5m'``. Activating 1h requires (a) porting the user-type
    /subscription/overage signals, (b) calling this function with real
    inputs at session start, AND (c) populating
    ``prompt_cache_1h_allowlist`` from a Python-equivalent of the TS
    GrowthBook config. All three are deferred to a future WI.
