"""Client-side advisor tool — the dispatch handler for ``tool_use(name=advisor)``.

This tool only fires in client-side advisor mode (3P providers or
``advisor_client_mode=True``). The server-side path emits
``server_tool_use`` blocks that the API handles; that path never
reaches this dispatcher.

The tool takes no parameters: the conversation history is forwarded
implicitly via ``ToolContext.messages`` (populated by ``_call_model_sync``
before the per-turn tool round). The advisor's reply is returned as
plain text in the ``ToolResult``.

``is_enabled`` is permanently False so the tool stays out of ``/tools``
listings and out of the default schema produced by ``get_tools``;
``_call_model_sync`` appends the schema manually only when client-side
mode is active for the request. The registry still finds the tool by
name when the dispatcher routes a matching ``tool_use`` block.
