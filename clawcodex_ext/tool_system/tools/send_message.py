"""SendMessage tool — Chunk F / WI-7.1 + WI-7.2 + WI-7.3.

Mirrors ``typescript/src/tools/SendMessageTool/SendMessageTool.ts``.
The universal communication primitive for inter-agent messaging:
plain text from leader → teammate, structured protocol envelopes
(shutdown, plan-approval), and broadcasts.

Routing dispatch chain (matches TS dispatch order — preserved as
real branches even for the out-of-scope schemes so a future addition
is a localized body change, not a re-ordering):

1. ``bridge:<session-id>`` — cross-machine via Anthropic's Remote
   Control relay. **NotImplementedError stub** (out of scope per
   ambiguity #5).
2. ``uds:<socket-path>`` — local IPC via Unix-domain socket.
   **NotImplementedError stub** (out of scope).
3. **In-process** — registry first, raw agent_id fallback. If the
   target is a running ``local_agent``, queue the message via
   ``queue_pending_message``; if terminal, attempt
   ``resume_agent_background`` (race-guarded).
4. **Team mailbox** — when team context is active and the recipient
   isn't an in-process agent, write a JSONL line to
   ``<team>/<recipient>.jsonl``. ``"*"`` → broadcast to every team
   member except the sender.
5. **Error** — recipient not found in any branch.

Structured protocols
--------------------

The ``message`` field is a union: plain text (``str``) or one of
``shutdown_request`` / ``shutdown_response`` /
``plan_approval_response``. The latter carries sender-side
authorization (``is_team_lead``) for plan approvals; receiver-side
verification (envelope ``from`` matches ``lead_agent_id``) is the
mailbox poller's job — see ``src/services/swarm/mailbox_poller.py``.

Defense-in-depth note: the sender-side ``is_team_lead`` gate refuses
``plan_approval_response`` from non-leader callers. The receiver-side
``from`` check (in the poller) refuses envelopes that claim to be
from the leader but were written through some other path — covers
the case where a future malicious / buggy code path bypasses the
SendMessage gate entirely.
