"""Team-aware tool pool assembly.

Higher-level wrapper around :func:`extensions.tool_system_ext.team_filter.filter_team_only_tools`
that pulls the full tool list from a ``ToolRegistry`` and applies the
team-context filter in one call. This is the single entry point the
caller sites in ``src/query/agent_loop_compat.py`` and
``clawcodex_ext/repl/core.py`` use to materialize their model-facing
tool list.

Decoupling rationale: the upstream tool system (``src/tool_system``)
owns tool definitions, the extension layer (``extensions/`` and
``clawcodex_ext/``) owns the policy of which tools are visible under
which conditions. Putting the policy in extensions means a single
deployment can override the visibility rule without forking the
upstream registry code.
