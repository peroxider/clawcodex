    The registry is built in two stages:

    * **Stage A (synchronous)** — the 51 core tools in ``ALL_STATIC_TOOLS``,
      plus the ``Agent`` and tool-search tools. These are needed for any
      conversation to function and are always registered before this
      function returns.
    * **Stage B (deferred)** — extension tools (Playwright / Pillow /
      MCP-SDK-dependent chrome tools, lodestone, bg-session, task
      directives, etc.), persisted agent-created tools, and the workflow
      tool. These cost ~3s of import + instantiation on cold start.

    When ``defer_extended_tools=True``, Stage B runs on a daemon thread
    and returns immediately. By the time the user submits their first
    prompt and the LLM round-trip begins, Stage B has typically finished.
    Concurrent reads (e.g. ``/tools`` command, ``tool_to_api_schema``)
    see whichever tools have been registered so far; the LLM's tool list
    is rebuilt on every turn (``get_team_aware_tool_list``), so the next
    turn after Stage B completes surfaces the additional tools.

    Default ``defer_extended_tools=False`` preserves the blocking
    behaviour for unit tests and non-interactive callers (orchestrator,
    remote API runner, CLI ``/tools`` command).
